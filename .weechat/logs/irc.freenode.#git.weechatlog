2010-10-12 09:52:42	_pingu	host b has a git repo clone from host a. now there were made changes on both hosts. How can I merge them? Here is my try: git pull   ssh://ping@10.42.222.11/tmp/a/.git                    But it says: Branch missing. Questions: 1.) Is pull the right command? 2.) How can I specify a branch?
2010-10-12 09:53:19	cxreg	_pingu: try adding "master" to the end?
2010-10-12 09:54:09	albel727	guardian: of course -N won't do, it doesn't add content to the index, how do you expect stash to save index's state?
2010-10-12 09:54:17	cxreg	pull is a fine choice there, though if you do frequent sharing you might consider setting up a bare repo to push into

2010-10-12 09:55:29	cxreg	_pingu: also, if you're going to pull from the host more than once, you should name it, eg "git remote add other-box ssh://ping@10.42.222.11/tmp/a/"
2010-10-12 09:55:47	cxreg	then you could git fetch other-box, etc

2010-10-12 09:58:52	albel727	cxreg: hmm, never used it myself. sure it "tracks", but it doesn't add actual content to the index, how possibly can "git-write-tree" compose a tree for commiting in this case?
2010-10-12 09:59:17	cxreg	albel727: git-write-tree knows how to commit 0 byte files, no?
2010-10-12 10:00:17	cxreg	it's a tree entry pointing to an empty blob

2010-10-12 10:00:34	albel727	cxreg: oh, so that's how it works. I see. but what would be the point of such a stash, then? the content will be lost.
2010-10-12 10:00:41	charon	cxreg: 331fcb59 made it actively refuse to write files flagged as -N. which i guess is ok usually, but broke git-stash in this case
2010-10-12 10:01:01	cxreg	albel727: stash saves 2 commits, one of the index, one of the unstaged changes
2010-10-12 10:01:02	charon	albel727: the worktree part of the stash would presumably still contain the contents
2010-10-12 10:01:12	cxreg	however it fails, so this is all moot
2010-10-12 10:01:37	cxreg	charon: ah
2010-10-12 10:02:25	cxreg	i wonder why junio changed that
2010-10-12 10:02:35	cxreg	seems rather harmless

2010-10-12 10:05:12	albel727	cxreg: silently committing empty blobs instead of files doesn't sound harmless to me.

2010-10-12 10:07:34	charon	cxreg: the empty blob is an implementation detail. the user only asked for the INTENT_TO_ADD flag...
2010-10-12 10:07:50	charon	(the empty blob is only there because we have to give *some* blob, and the empty one makes sense for diffs)
2010-10-12 10:08:31	cxreg	oh well, not a big enough deal to raise a fuss

2010-10-12 10:10:36	albel727	cxreg: yeah, running around and screaming "where is my source?!? where is my source!?! i swear I have committed it yesterday!!" is what we want people to do, anyway =D
2010-10-12 10:11:14	cxreg	more often than rarely do i "git add -N file && git add -p file"
2010-10-12 10:11:20	cxreg	to commit just a small fragment of a new file
2010-10-12 10:11:31	guardian	cxreg: i'm convinced wip commits are the way to go; however which git reset command should i use? i saw on stackoverflow.com git reset --soft HEAD~; git reset
2010-10-12 10:11:47	guardian	cxreg: would there be another command line easier to remember?
2010-10-12 10:11:50	jim	does this implementation detail of committing a blob have the effect of changing the structure of a repo, perhaps making conversion necessary?
2010-10-12 10:12:00	albel727	cxreg: hmm, wouldn't it be just the same as "git add -p" file?

2010-10-12 10:13:17	cxreg	it has to be known to the index first

2010-10-12 10:14:53	albel727	cxreg: now, that's unexpected. then, with "add; add -p" you'll be rather unstaging majority of hunks that are already in index, rather than adding a single hunk from file. I see.
2010-10-12 10:16:19	cxreg	except that add can't unstage, but you could reset -p

2010-10-12 10:18:59	guardian	is there any intended difference between git reset --soft HEAD~; git reset and git reset HEAD^ ?
