2011-01-13 11:14:05	wheels	bonsaikitten: but nevertheless the whole tell-them-dirty-non-jews idea was his.
2011-01-13 11:15:00	bonsaikitten	well, the whole "woman in the kitchen" thing grew on his compost heap too
2011-01-13 11:16:06	wheels	Well, to be fair, that wasn't a particularly unique feature to the christian outlook.
2011-01-13 11:17:14	wheels	I mean, even in our oh-so-modern world, Switzerland just gave women universal sufferage about 20 years ago.

2011-01-13 11:18:49	bonsaikitten	and it was only one kanton with ~15k inhabitants that refused, not all of .ch
2011-01-13 11:20:03	wheels	Iran was, however before Switzerland in giving women the right to vote at all.
2011-01-13 11:22:08	wheels	But yeah, point was simply that the notion of women not being marginal is fairly modern.
2011-01-13 11:24:53	bonsaikitten	well, swiss kantons are very independent, the country is a union and not one single country
2011-01-13 11:25:18	bonsaikitten	blaming all of switzerland for a group of mountain trolls is a bit mean ;)
2011-01-13 11:26:21	wheels	bonsaikitten: well, it was still one of the last developed countries to get women's sufferage ... all the way in the 70s.

2011-01-13 11:41:30	EvRide	of course, of course
2011-01-13 11:41:55	EvRide	it wouldn't be a liberation without fireworks

If I did that all the time it would be disorienting, but there are so few distractions at night I'm usually quite productive, and the lack of sleep actually helps me be creative sometimes.

2011-01-13 16:41:02	SDr	ReinDeerArmy, yes, many; probably no for present company
2011-01-13 16:41:09	ReinDeerArmy	i am considering a site that provides tools and analysis
2011-01-13 16:41:19	h34t	in high school I"d never start an essay before midnight. It was pointless, my writing would be stilted. I needed to be a little tired for my mind to let its guard down.
2011-01-13 16:41:31	ReinDeerArmy	but the focus would be on one specific currency pair
2011-01-13 16:41:41	rmah	ReinDeerArmy: ok... I used to work in forex

2011-01-13 16:41:51	zinssmeister	a friend of mine in the Valley did a soft launch of www.gopollgo.com and it's kind of addictive to answer those polls
2011-01-13 16:42:02	rmah	my tip about forex trading... don't do it.

2011-01-13 16:43:32	ReinDeerArmy	the new innovation is a proprietary algorithm for predictive modeling
2011-01-13 16:44:03	ReinDeerArmy	i am working on an interactive interface done in html5 with animations etc
2011-01-13 16:44:26	ReinDeerArmy	my only concern is that the market is too small

2011-01-13 16:45:20	Angostura	The market for a truly innovative modelling algorithm would presumably be smallish but very lucrative
2011-01-13 16:45:38	ReinDeerArmy	I mean its nothing that isnt in the literature
2011-01-13 16:45:48	Angostura	Oh
2011-01-13 16:46:02	ReinDeerArmy	but providing a web interface could allow the user to manipulate the variables
2011-01-13 16:46:04	Angostura	I thought you might have something that might be licensable to a big shop
2011-01-13 16:46:09	rmah	ReinDeerArmy: have you ever worked at a shop that trades forex?
2011-01-13 16:46:14	ReinDeerArmy	and allow interactive modelling
2011-01-13 16:46:28	rmah	ReinDeerArmy: if your system can actually make money for a bank that trades forex, you can sell it to them.  for big $$$
2011-01-13 16:46:32	ReinDeerArmy	i have a think or swim account but never traded spot
2011-01-13 16:46:40	rmah	that's not what I asked
2011-01-13 16:46:44	ReinDeerArmy	;)
2011-01-13 16:46:49	rmah	ReinDeerArmy: have you ever worked on the street?
2011-01-13 16:46:57	ReinDeerArmy	nope not directly
2011-01-13 16:47:05	ReinDeerArmy	why do you ask?
2011-01-13 16:47:07	rmah	"not directly"?
2011-01-13 16:47:16	rmah	so you've worked for firms that worked for banks?
2011-01-13 16:47:18	ReinDeerArmy	have done contract programming
2011-01-13 16:47:23	rmah	ok
2011-01-13 16:47:27	ReinDeerArmy	for financial services firms
2011-01-13 16:47:31	rmah	gotcha
2011-01-13 16:47:48	rmah	then I don't understand why you'd think tools for forex traders would be a small market
2011-01-13 16:48:02	ReinDeerArmy	so i dont have a heckuva lotta contacts 'on the street' as it were
2011-01-13 16:48:20	rmah	ReinDeerArmy: each trader at a bank deals with an absurd amount of money
2011-01-13 16:48:46	rmah	if you can demonstrate/prove that you'll help them increase their profits by 1% you can easily charge $10's of thousands per seat
2011-01-13 16:48:46	ReinDeerArmy	i know billions in spot trades
2011-01-13 16:49:00	rmah	hell, more
2011-01-13 16:49:05	ReinDeerArmy	ok thanks i will definitely consider this
2011-01-13 16:50:02	ReinDeerArmy	the predictive algorithm would be familiar to any with ai/ml experience
2011-01-13 16:50:14	rmah	does it work?

2011-01-13 20:19:54	aristid_	now, according to the docs, S3 actually ignores query parameters (other than those for the alternative auth method).
2011-01-13 20:19:56	aristid_	maybe the docs are wrong, or this is a practical joke by notch

2011-01-13 20:28:57	Cyndre	get 100 - 1000 storys, then say for 6 months you want 3 a day - then each day add your storys to flesh out the low posts
2011-01-13 20:28:58	TK-421	but looks at the monthly impressions
2011-01-13 20:29:42	sadiq	well, he's making 450+900+500+(0.061*820*0.5) by the looks of it
2011-01-13 20:30:00	TK-421	then take 25% off the top for the ad network fees
2011-01-13 20:30:08	sadiq	so ~$1.5k/month net
2011-01-13 20:30:37	TK-421	not too bad for just a couple minutes a day of clicking buttons :)

2011-01-13 20:49:22	tommoor	theres nothing to stop people creating a weight gain challenge ... its just that the winner would be the wrong way round
2011-01-13 20:49:26	tommoor	and the leaderboard
2011-01-13 20:49:49	tommoor	I sense a pivot

2011-01-13 21:13:28	MikeyG	ah scroll, how i've missed you
2011-01-13 21:13:55	m1d0	japherwocky, and what are the right frameworks?
2011-01-13 21:14:20	m1d0	and yup, dolinsky, i just want to at least have some basic knowledge so i'm not compmletely clueless if asked about it by potential investors, etc
2011-01-13 21:15:29	rmah	Foreign taxi driver: If you know anything, you find job in New York. If you know nothing, you drive cab.  <= well said
2011-01-13 21:15:33	dolinsky	well, you can scale up, and you can scale out. most everyone you'll find on HN and that uses FOSS platforms scale out
2011-01-13 21:15:37	tommoor	Intellect: true.. i did consider maybe a recommended area of the site where people could post books / dvds etc they have used and  take affiliate
2011-01-13 21:15:40	haploid	m1d0: the "right" frameworks according to the HN groupthink are arc and RoR.  Everything else is just too unsexy to be considered worthwhile.
2011-01-13 21:15:44	tommoor	not entirely sure how it would work as yet
2011-01-13 21:16:10	dolinsky	m1d0, for php, look at lithium
2011-01-13 21:16:21	rmah	worry about getting customers first.  THEN worry about scaling.
2011-01-13 21:16:33	tommoor	exactly
2011-01-13 21:16:35	m1d0	of course
2011-01-13 21:16:45	dolinsky	not sure if you are on php 5.3 yet but if you are and have a really solid foundation of PHP then lithium could suit you well
2011-01-13 21:17:46	dolinsky	but you also have to find what fits your way of working best... so you can't necessarily go 'wrong' with others like cake/symfony/kohana/codeigniter

2011-01-13 21:19:51	japherwocky	heroku or appengine are pretty bulletproof
2011-01-13 21:20:21	m1d0	yeah, i'm building in php because i don't know ruby. but may have time during these early prototypes to learn ruby and just go with heroku
2011-01-13 21:20:24	m1d0	that would be ideal
2011-01-13 21:20:29	tommoor	Gary_b: a respected brand like that would be a good sponsor

2011-01-13 21:21:12	dolinsky	w/r/t python, would it be best to learn on the 2.7 track so one could use Django?

2011-01-14 00:10:02	m1d0	yeah, the built-in community for reblogging etc is a huge plus i think
2011-01-14 00:10:06	TK-421	Like you can't import images unless it's for a custom theme, so I had to use CSS3 stuff.
2011-01-14 00:10:17	TK-421	Yeah it's almost like a built-in stumble.
2011-01-14 00:10:41	TK-421	So I've followed about 100 people now so far, haven't got any followers back yet but that will change. Then when they see my updates, they'll reblog and the world will be good. :)
2011-01-14 00:10:52	JackHerrick	Thanks.  And you control the theme in CSS?
2011-01-14 00:10:58	relix	and the money will flow!
2011-01-14 00:11:02	JackHerrick	I liked it on FB.  :)
2011-01-14 00:11:14	TK-421	You use a prebuilt CSS and then add to it.

2011-01-14 00:12:23	TK-421	So for the next 5 days I'll have 100 new eyes on it a day with a chance to get Stumbled.

2011-01-14 01:32:12	jacquesm	that was definitely a hard core cam site
2011-01-14 01:32:14	Gary_B	heauxbag: i dont think so

2011-01-14 01:32:34	jacquesm	the only ones with any info in them were the adult ones
2011-01-14 01:32:50	jacquesm	because HN is on the blink and very slow so it tends to time out
2011-01-14 01:33:08	jacquesm	now if it timed out before your comment/submission was processed then there is nothing on the other side
2011-01-14 01:33:18	ReinDeerArmy	but what if you really just wanted a facebook app for legit normal folks who want to meet for casual sex?
2011-01-14 01:33:19	jacquesm	in that case refresh and it's reposted
2011-01-14 01:33:20	Gary_B	heauxbag: cogar = old women, jocks = young men, paid sex doesnt come into it

2011-01-14 01:51:51	hackus-	its a dorky idea
2011-01-14 01:51:55	Cyndre	elkclone: so were thinking of flipping the tables and offering to integrate their data into our system - giving them updated maps, and they would just submit the data to us
2011-01-14 01:52:00	ReinDeerArmy	Gary_B: but with real live (indian) humans on the other end

2011-01-14 01:55:09	Gary_B	ReinDeerArmy: i was thinking in the terms of targetting those who feel they could do with speaking about their problems with someone but wouldnt take the step to seek actual help from acouncillor. 911 would be reffered away from the site, not asked for $99 a month, please pay 6 up front!!
2011-01-14 01:55:12	elkclone	providing they sell a lot of units with your apps installed.
2011-01-14 01:55:41	rmah	ReinDeerArmy: not very
2011-01-14 01:55:57	Cyndre	yea, combined our systems are awsome - they pinpoint 10 devices that could be the problem, I can pinpoint the area the problems in - combined we have a killer system
2011-01-14 01:56:07	ReinDeerArmy	rmah: so what would u use? private reports from banks?
2011-01-14 01:56:45	rmah	ReinDeerArmy: forex is mostly affected by macroeconomic stats/news and government policy

2011-01-14 04:24:28	arubin	In real life no one avoids hitting the back of their opponent's head for instance.
2011-01-14 04:24:29	Etherael	the gloves are mostly to protect the hands, rather than to protect the target, they're not anything like boxing gloves for example.
2011-01-14 04:24:46	Etherael	"one good punch to the back of the head" is different to "one good punch"

2011-01-14 07:11:58	wahnfrieden	so you'd have to shrink it carefully
2011-01-14 07:12:21	warz	yea. i had planned on making the radius user-defined, but defaulted to relatively small.
2011-01-14 07:12:28	wahnfrieden	dependent on density and activity or something

2011-01-14 07:12:40	warz	because, obviously it can get as big as possible and broadcast to everyone otherwise. heh

2011-01-14 12:34:00	gianp	In what segments does google have a monopoly except search?
2011-01-14 12:34:13	BlackWhite	none
2011-01-14 12:34:17	working-afk	gianp: travel
2011-01-14 12:34:24	BlackWhite	huh?
2011-01-14 12:34:34	gianp	Erm, aren't there huge travel sites that dwarf google?
2011-01-14 12:34:36	BlackWhite	ITA is not the only player

2011-01-14 12:35:01	BlackWhite	working-afk well that doesn
2011-01-14 12:35:08	gianp	but I'm not sure your assertion "google's practices are very monopolistic" is true
2011-01-14 12:35:11	BlackWhite	t mean they have it and it's certainly not for the entire world
2011-01-14 12:35:19	working-afk	gianp: it certainly is true
2011-01-14 12:35:21	gianp	Because they have kinda failed at monopoly if that's what they are trying.
2011-01-14 12:35:23	BlackWhite	there is amadeus
2011-01-14 12:35:23	working-afk	ask anyone
