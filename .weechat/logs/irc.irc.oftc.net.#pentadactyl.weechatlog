2011-01-18 22:55:10	quesada	is there a setting to revert to the :open behaviour in vimperator? i.e. no tab completion, instead full first match completion, plus arrow keys
2011-01-18 22:55:45	John-Galt	:set autocomplete=
2011-01-18 22:57:07	quesada	hm,
2011-01-18 22:57:19	quesada	but arrows do nothing then
2011-01-18 22:57:32	John-Galt	What do you mean?
2011-01-18 22:57:34	quesada	I hope I didn't screw up my config
2011-01-18 22:58:16	quesada	I want to type : mai and get mail.google.com. then I press enter
2011-01-18 22:58:22	quesada	no need for tab, nor options
2011-01-18 22:58:45	quesada	or maybe it was mai<up><enter>
2011-01-18 22:59:16	John-Galt	Yeah, it was probably that. Vimperator never had the former behavior.
2011-01-18 22:59:36	quesada	ok, then :) how do I get that in pdactyl?
2011-01-18 22:59:41	quesada	great name btw
2011-01-18 23:00:25	John-Galt	It should just work.
2011-01-18 23:00:37	quesada	nope, arrows do nothing
2011-01-18 23:00:44	 *	John-Galt gets more complaints about the name than anything else...
2011-01-18 23:00:47	John-Galt	quesada: :version ?
2011-01-18 23:01:07	quesada	1,0b2
2011-01-18 23:01:18	John-Galt	You might have some mappings screwing with history, I suppose.
2011-01-18 23:01:26	John-Galt	quesada: Oh, that's old. You need to upgrade... badly.
2011-01-18 23:01:34	quesada	aha
2011-01-18 23:02:05	Chousuke	John-Galt: When were you planning to release 1.0? After FF4?
2011-01-18 23:02:39	John-Galt	Chousuke: That was the plan, since they keep adding bloody breaking changes to the beta line.
2011-01-18 23:02:46	Chousuke	heh
2011-01-18 23:03:30	John-Galt	Granted, so do I, but I don't have thousands of developers writing plugins for my code.
2011-01-18 23:04:08	quesada	now I'm on 1.0b3, still arrows do nothing after set auc=
2011-01-18 23:04:13	John-Galt	Actually, come to think of it, no I don't. I keep adding deprecation warnings...
2011-01-18 23:04:33	John-Galt	quesada: You want 1.0b4.3. At any rate, you probably have some mapping issues.
2011-01-18 23:06:19	quesada	now it works, thanks
2011-01-18 23:06:42	John-Galt	What fixed it?
2011-01-18 23:07:33	quesada	I guess history was reset
2011-01-18 23:07:51	quesada	I typed the full url once, then pdactyl found it with the arrows the seocnd time
2011-01-18 23:08:33	John-Galt	Heh. History isn't carried over from Vimperator unless you mv ~/.{vimperator,pentadactyl} if that's what you mean.
2011-01-18 23:08:51	quesada	that was it
2011-01-18 23:09:54	quesada	should I rename my vimperatorrc to pentadactylrc?
2011-01-18 23:10:03	John-Galt	I suppose I should add that to the FAQ. I know there are a couple of migration guides on the interwebs.
2011-01-18 23:10:17	John-Galt	quesada: It would probably a good start, but be prepared for some errors.
2011-01-18 23:13:52	quesada	thanks John
2011-01-18 23:14:06	quesada	one last thing. I have noremap <C-c> <C-v><C-c> and noremap <C-v> <C-v><C-v>
2011-01-18 23:14:41	quesada	this is to emulate windows copy-paste. But it requires double keystrokes (ctrl-c twice). Is there a better way?
2011-01-18 23:14:48	quesada	ie only one keystroke?
2011-01-18 23:16:38	John-Galt	It's probably fixed in b5.
2011-01-18 23:16:43	John-Galt	Or b4.3 even.
2011-01-18 23:17:16	quesada	great! where do I get this? I thought I got the latest v... trice today :P
2011-01-18 23:17:24	John-Galt	Where did you download from?
2011-01-18 23:17:45	quesada	http://dactyl.sourceforge.net/pentadactyl/index#sect-support
2011-01-18 23:18:02	quesada	so b4.3 doesn't have it fixed
2011-01-18 23:18:03	John-Galt	:extup Pentadactyl

2011-01-19 00:02:55	John-Galt	Doesn't make sense. If anything the first <C-v> should start QUOTE mode.

2011-01-19 05:02:34	John-Galt	They're the ones who like to go on about how homeopathy is god's gift to humanity and vaccines cause autism, aren't they?
2011-01-19 05:02:41	thesnowdog	...you're so judgmental
2011-01-19 05:03:24	thesnowdog	No idea but that's how I like to think of homeopathy.
2011-01-19 05:03:42	thesnowdog	I'd never heard of the Huffington Post prior to this.
2011-01-19 05:04:04	John-Galt	Well, it's hard not to be judgemental of people wo think that pure water is the most potent form of medial treatment available... and gets more powerful the more it's diluted.
2011-01-19 05:04:29	thesnowdog	Heh, if it works for them.
2011-01-19 05:05:07	John-Galt	Yeah, placebos have their uses.
2011-01-19 05:05:25	John-Galt	And telling people that vaccines will give their kids autism? That's alright?
2011-01-19 05:05:29	thesnowdog	A friend of mine who is a doctor goes off like a cracker every time it's mentioned.
2011-01-19 05:05:40	John-Galt	Heh
2011-01-19 05:06:19	thesnowdog	Well telling anyone anything is alright.
2011-01-19 05:06:32	milant	q: is anyone using ffox in fullscreen mode? wondering what the intended display of the commandline and statusline are in fullscreen?
2011-01-19 05:06:48	John-Galt	Whatever you set them to be.
2011-01-19 05:07:32	milant	they disappear off the botttom of the screen for me in fullscreen (i'm on nightlies for both ffox and pentadactyl)
2011-01-19 05:07:40	John-Galt	thesnowdog: Maybe. Nevertheless it's leading to epidemics or whooping cough and measles already.
2011-01-19 05:07:55	John-Galt	Especially the former in infants, and especially in your country at that.
2011-01-19 05:08:09	John-Galt	milant: You can turn them back on.
2011-01-19 05:08:42	thesnowdog	John-Galt: Sure, that topic sets my sister of like a cracker. :)
2011-01-19 05:09:51	thesnowdog	John-Galt: We like to be ahead of the game down here.  It's the Vitamin K shots...everyone knows it.
2011-01-19 05:11:05	milant	john-galt: u mean w/ set go=cs?
2011-01-19 05:11:42	John-Galt	thesnowdog: But surely a *vitamin* can't do any harm?
2011-01-19 05:11:45	John-Galt	milant: +=
2011-01-19 05:11:55	milant	in full screen the command-line is gone (it's there in non-fullscreen)
2011-01-19 05:12:06	milant	ya +=, same thing
2011-01-19 05:12:51	John-Galt	Not really...
2011-01-19 05:13:05	John-Galt	The command-line is hidden by default anyway.
2011-01-19 05:15:25	milant	no, i meant the same issue either way. command-line won't appear when i hit :
2011-01-19 05:15:49	milant	seems to be blocked by the status bar. tho the status-bar displays "COMMAND LINE"
2011-01-19 05:16:11	John-Galt	I think you want a C in there.
2011-01-19 05:16:34	John-Galt	Hm. Interesting. No status bar either way...
2011-01-19 05:16:49	thesnowdog	John-Galt: Well who's to say what it really is... And bleeding to death isn't as bad as it's made out to be.  When you're that young it's not as though you understand.
2011-01-19 05:17:13	John-Galt	Stupid bloody moz-collapsed attribute. I thought I fixed that.
2011-01-19 05:17:45	John-Galt	milant: :au fullscreen .* statusline.statusBar.removeAttribute("moz-collapsed")
2011-01-19 05:18:15	John-Galt	thesnowdog: Whooping cough doesn't lead to bleeding to death, it leads to death by suffocation.
2011-01-19 05:18:42	thesnowdog	Vitamin K ^
2011-01-19 05:19:03	John-Galt	Aah.
2011-01-19 05:19:23	John-Galt	:) I was confused for a minute...
2011-01-19 05:21:36	milant	john-galt; thnx. but it gives the error "E216: no such group or event: fullscreen"
2011-01-19 05:21:49	milant	tho i can still :set fullscreen
2011-01-19 05:23:59	John-Galt	Fullscreen rather.
2011-01-19 05:24:24	thesnowdog	John-Galt: FWIW, most of my family on both sides (the generation above me) had whooping cough.  I don't think they recommend it.
2011-01-19 05:24:48	John-Galt	Heh
2011-01-19 05:25:40	 *	John-Galt considers whether constructing HTML from strings should be a hanging offense. Especially when said strings are composed of fragments grabbed from wild Internet pages and injected into a document with chrome privileges...
2011-01-19 05:27:48	milant	i get E492 not a pentadactyl command: statusline.statusBar.removeAttribute("moz-collapsed")
2011-01-19 05:28:05	John-Galt	:au Fullscreen .* -js statusline.statusBar.removeAttribute("moz-collapsed")
2011-01-19 05:28:14	milant	should i have that in my rc file?
2011-01-19 05:28:26	John-Galt	thesnowdog: Shouldn't autocommands be case insensitive?
2011-01-19 05:31:20	milant	ok. i had to throw it in my rc. then source my rc from ffox. seems to work now.
2011-01-19 05:31:22	milant	thnx!

2011-01-19 05:35:08	John-Galt	Keypress handling is too slow now.
2011-01-19 05:36:55	milant	ok. here's another one....
2011-01-19 05:37:42	milant	this gives an error of "invalid option" :noremap - zo
2011-01-19 05:37:56	milant	yet "noremap + zo" works fine
2011-01-19 05:38:13	milant	is - reserved in vim?
2011-01-19 05:38:28	John-Galt	That's because - starts an option. You need to quote it.
2011-01-19 05:39:34	thesnowdog	John-Galt: I guess so...
2011-01-19 05:41:17	milant	ah, ok.
2011-01-19 05:41:31	milant	worked. that was user error then. thnx again.

2011-01-19 06:06:56	John-Galt	Should benchmark.
2011-01-19 06:24:19	milant	what is the diff between "map <C-k> -ex open javascript:function....." and "map <C-k> :open javascript:function...."?
2011-01-19 06:25:06	milant	also, should the javascript bookmarklets be opened with the -js option?
2011-01-19 06:25:23	John-Galt	The former is much more efficient and reliable. The latter acts exactly as if you'd typed all of those keys.
2011-01-19 06:25:40	John-Galt	Bookmarklets should be opened like any other bookmarks.
2011-01-19 06:29:56	milant	ok. for debugging/feedback, is the best thing to just crank verbose=infinity? or 15...? :P
2011-01-19 06:31:03	John-Galt	Possibly...

2011-01-19 07:36:37	thesnowdog	John-Galt: Is Goldacre the bloke you mentioned who was sued for critizing chiropractors?
2011-01-19 07:37:13	John-Galt	He was one of them. Simon Singh was the other. I think Goldacre might have been sued by homeopaths...
2011-01-19 07:38:00	_temp_	John-Galt: thanks, i was used to vimperator's ;f :)
2011-01-19 07:38:11	John-Galt	Ah, he got sued by some asshole who he criticized for selling vitamin pills to Africans as a cure for AIDS...
2011-01-19 07:38:38	thesnowdog	Well it's better than raping white devils I suppose.
2011-01-19 07:38:52	John-Galt	_temp_: Vimperator's ;F was a horrible idea. Someone sent a patch. I said we shouldn't accept it, but...

2011-01-19 07:44:47	John-Galt	It's water.
2011-01-19 07:45:26	thesnowdog	I think I'd always thought it was a seventies thing.  Along with crystals. *shrug*
2011-01-19 07:46:01	John-Galt	:) There was one scientist who ruined his career by publishing a paper promoting the idea that water has memory (no-one could reproduce the results)...
2011-01-19 07:46:10	John-Galt	Now :) This is precious...
2011-01-19 07:46:28	John-Galt	He sells homeopathic remedies that work over the phone and Internet.
2011-01-19 07:46:46	tlonim	hmm
2011-01-19 07:46:46	thesnowdog	Oh, I recall that.
2011-01-19 07:47:03	John-Galt	I almost felt bad for the guy before I found that out.
2011-01-19 07:47:18	thesnowdog	Apparently it's all in the shaking after each dilution.  I understand now.

2011-01-19 07:51:42	tlonim	but it won't work for serious ailments
2011-01-19 07:52:14	tlonim	may be thats how homeopathy has gained traction
2011-01-19 07:52:25	tlonim	I have seen it being used mainly for cold related stuff
2011-01-19 07:54:52	John-Galt	Well, as it happens, a lot of "homeopathic" remedies have actual ingredients. Zicam, for instance, has zinc, which is why it caused people to lose their sense of smell. "Homeopathic" pink eye remedies have boric acid, which is why they actually work.
2011-01-19 07:56:21	tlonim	i have seen homeopathic treatments being used in places where the side effects of normal medicines are too severe
2011-01-19 07:56:34	tlonim	which again applies for cough cold related ones

2011-01-21 21:06:15	stepnem	John-Galt, Monkey: Let's close issue 269, too. I don't use sidebars, but I don't find the alternative :sidebar suggestions persuasive (the person didn't even notice :sbclose reading :h :sidebar).
2011-01-21 21:06:16	+eris_prime	Bug http://dactyl.sf.net/bug/269 ---, New, Enhancement, Medium, :sidebar! could open/close the sidebar
2011-01-21 21:14:24	milant	stepnem: i saw the sidebar req earlier too, i remember i was looking for something similar at the time. it would seem easier to have a simple default :sidebar and :sidebar! boolean toggle
2011-01-21 21:14:48	stepnem	!@#$$*)
2011-01-21 21:22:33	milant	:P
2011-01-21 21:23:24	milant	it felt like the natural thing to look for. i have a feeling it'll be a frequently made request.
2011-01-21 21:24:35	milant	stepnem: :sidebar has no utility for me either, but it was one of the first things i grokked for in the beginning
2011-01-21 21:25:54	stepnem	milant: It's not like you can't define your own command in terms of :sidebar and :sbclose.
2011-01-21 21:26:38	milant	stepnem: right. NOW i know. but in the beginning i wasn't familiar in terms of the vim conventions.
2011-01-21 21:27:03	milant	stepnem: i'm indifferent really. just saying that u might get others making the same request.
2011-01-21 21:27:08	stepnem	You should make yourself familiar before requesting features based on your unfamiliarity.
2011-01-21 21:27:34	stepnem	As I said, the guy didn't even notice :sbclose at all.
2011-01-21 21:27:56	milant	stepnem: ya, i didn't make it. :P
2011-01-21 21:29:17	milant	stepnem: in general, if it FEELS like a boolean command, i think the default action should be :cmd and :cmd! with everything else optional whipped cream and cherries
2011-01-21 21:30:41	stepnem	Well, we can just make :sidebar! do the same as :sbclose.
2011-01-21 21:30:54	stepnem	Wouldn't hurt I guess.
2011-01-21 21:31:43	milant	stepnem: i had the same problem earlier today with the "Zoom Text Only" command where i had a hard time finding it because they were receiving values rather than being a straightfoward :set! zoomTextOnly that matched the menu state and functionality.
2011-01-21 21:32:09	milant	stepnem: but in that case it's more a documentation issue. i couldn't find it in my search
2011-01-21 21:32:44	stepnem	milant: What documentation issue? :h zoom
2011-01-21 21:33:49	milant	stepnem: exactly. i associated that with "zoom in" and zoom out", and i was looking for "zoom text only" and its permutations
2011-01-21 21:34:58	stepnem	Come on. The documentation specifically says "text zoom" as opposed to "full zoom"
2011-01-21 21:35:27	milant	stepnem: like i said, in the ffox menu it's a boolean, yet in the docs it's a hybridized continuous value. but really, all that was needed was something beside the cmd that mentioned "zoom text only".
2011-01-21 21:36:13	milant	stepnem: ya, it's obvious after. but i was skimming thru looking for the actual text,. not doing a close reading. it happens. :(
2011-01-21 21:36:48	stepnem	I think what is needed is that you start thinking a bit about what you read instead of sticking to your assumptions about everything.
2011-01-21 21:41:17	milant	stepnem: ha. no i'm just playing devil's advocate here, trying to show what it looks like from an outsider's perspective who isn't familiar with the internals all that much.
2011-01-21 21:43:02	milant	stepnem: it's not a big deal, really. i'm just saying there's a couple small things that we could do to minimize the learning curve. you guys have been VERY helpful to me. and i'd like to repay it towards future users and minimize the main points of friction that i went thru. just sharing some insight, that's all.
2011-01-21 22:23:36	stepnem	Ugh, that noscript plugin really gives people headaches, doesn't it... :-P

2011-01-22 01:26:24	Chousuke	use tab or type something to narrow down the options
2011-01-22 01:29:13	winn	Chousuke: but that leaves me still in the command
2011-01-22 01:29:29	John-Galt	Page down in the completion list is a TODO. But it's a lot of work.
2011-01-22 01:30:21	winn	John-Galt: OK thanks.

2011-01-22 01:51:53	John-Galt	Monkey: Heh. It gave me a brief laugh, but I didn't think that much of it to be honest. It's just Gervais being Gervais.
2011-01-22 01:52:13	John-Galt	But I've been meaning to watch the awards show. I heard he was pretty good through most of it.
2011-01-22 01:53:05	John-Galt	Admittedly, it takes balls to say something like that to an American audience, and it was good in context given how many people thank god or Jesus in their acceptance speeches.
2011-01-22 01:53:28	Monkey	I was just watching the Piers Morgan interview with him.
2011-01-22 01:54:06	John-Galt	Ugh. Why would you watch Piers Morgan do anything?
2011-01-22 01:54:32	Monkey	I can't seem to stomach award shows anymore.  I liked them quite a bit when I was a kid.
2011-01-22 01:54:47	Monkey	John-Galt: Err, because his guests are interesting????
2011-01-22 01:55:09	John-Galt	Are they? Hard to believe given how deathly dull he is.

2011-01-22 01:55:40	John-Galt	I was just going to watch the good bits, whichever they are. Certainly not the acceptance speeches or most of the presenters.
2011-01-22 01:57:04	John-Galt	My sister and her husband are apparently switching to a homeopathic "doctor"... :(

2011-01-22 01:57:47	Monkey	John-Galt: I do understand why your thoughts on these matters border on the pathological.  I don't actually have to deal with any of them on a daily basis. :)

2011-01-22 01:58:41	 *	Monkey should probably expand his social circle to include more freaks
2011-01-22 02:00:15	John-Galt	Heh. I don't think I've had many friends who would go in for that kind of crap. Unfortunately, you can't choose your family the same way you choose your friends...
2011-01-22 02:01:02	John-Galt	Then again, I don't bite my tongue the same way with friends as I do with family, and I think that some of them would be scared to mention visiting a homeopath in my presence...
2011-01-22 02:02:23	John-Galt	Hm. But as I'm in the central boondocks of Florida now, I don't have any friends who are ever actually in my presence very often... I need to get out of here.
2011-01-22 02:03:00	 *	John-Galt wonders whether it would be worth teaching the syntax files to recognize options and such...
2011-01-22 02:03:09	John-Galt	Looking at vim.vim it seems like too damned much work.
2011-01-22 02:17:51	 *	Monkey explicitly chose to delete most of his family
2011-01-22 02:18:30	John-Galt	Heh. Does that make you a sociopath or just an ordinary serial killer?
2011-01-22 02:19:18	Monkey	I just makes me happy.
2011-01-22 02:19:25	Monkey	It
2011-01-22 02:20:13	John-Galt	Probably sociopath, then. Possibly psychopath. I've never been entirely clear on the distinction.
2011-01-22 02:21:59	John-Galt	Hm. :auto_view text/html is somewhat nice.
2011-01-22 02:22:08	John-Galt	Makes me happier.
2011-01-22 02:32:22	Monkey	You're just bitter that your sister didn't have the balls to follow through on her attempted deletion of yourself. ;)

2011-01-22 02:34:25	Monkey	Oh, now I recall.
2011-01-22 02:35:00	John-Galt	Eh, she's too flaky to alienate anyone for that long.
2011-01-22 02:38:19	Monkey	John-Galt: Why are you in Florida exactly again? You were working on some project for her husband?
2011-01-22 02:38:28	Monkey	...sorry my memory is crap these days.
2011-01-22 02:38:59	Monkey	What's stopping you from heading 'home' other than beer girl?
2011-01-22 02:40:12	John-Galt	Nah, she was in NJ. I really don't know why I'm in Florida, to be honest, except that I have family here and it's a lot cheaper to live up here.
2011-01-22 02:40:42	John-Galt	Anyway, I've got to find a new school sometime before the end of the month.
2011-01-22 02:41:10	Monkey	Any decisions on what you're studying?
2011-01-22 02:41:40	Monkey	I take it life as a little Googler wasn't looking so promising then? Or can you do both?
2011-01-22 02:41:44	John-Galt	Probably Physics, Maths, and CS. One major, two minors. Haven't decided which is which yet.
2011-01-22 02:42:07	John-Galt	I might wind up with an internship at Google. I'll see what I can do about that.
2011-01-22 02:42:29	Monkey	How does your current education fit into that? Don't you have some CS qualification already?
2011-01-22 02:42:38	Monkey	The US system always confuses me a bit.
2011-01-22 02:43:03	John-Galt	Yeah, I have an AAS, which is useless.
2011-01-22 02:44:09	Monkey	Google is failing me. AAS?
2011-01-22 02:44:59	John-Galt	Associates in Arts and Sciences
2011-01-22 02:46:09	John-Galt	Could be Associates in Applied Sciences, come to think of it.

2011-01-22 03:23:29	milant	John-Galt: everything has compromises tho. take the good with the bad. just have to figure out what yr willing to sacrifice and what u expect to get.

2011-01-22 03:38:14	milant	John-Galt: 3 or 4 years ago there was quite the exodus of physicists, and many of them transferred over into compsci research. i kid u not.
2011-01-22 03:39:03	milant	John-Galt: quite a bit of physics is computational modelling and algorithms and data mining and distributed/clustered computing, etc.
2011-01-22 03:39:28	John-Galt	Sorry... let me rephrase. I'm not especially interested in career advice from random people from the interwebs.
2011-01-22 03:40:20	milant	John-Galt: lots of overlap between ALL those 3 areas. i'm just saying there's much more sustenance in the compsci as a career if u end up dropping out or being disillusioned with academia.
2011-01-22 03:41:23	milant	John-Galt: ha. :) no problem. i understand. it's cool. just sharing what i've seen, heard, and been thru myself. i ain't selling anything. no worries there. :)

2011-01-22 11:02:28	stepnem	And the semantics is necessarily different from the toolbar commands, as you can only have one kind of sidebar.
2011-01-22 11:03:29	stepnem	That's why it seems to me like just making :sb! do :sbclose would make sense.
2011-01-22 11:03:37	John-Galt	I know there's no :sbtoggle. I said I was adding it.
2011-01-22 11:03:50	John-Galt	Making :foo! alias to :bar is just silly.
2011-01-22 11:04:32	stepnem	I don't see how is :sb! = :sbtoggle different from :sb! = :sbclose in that respect.
2011-01-22 11:06:35	John-Galt	Well, in the case I just wouldn't add a :sbtoggle command.
2011-01-22 11:08:05	stepnem	OK. Anyway, good to see you have some plans for it, so the issue is not just hanging there.

2011-01-22 11:33:05	iaj	John-Galt: btw, I tried yesterday, when I got h in a group mapping, it loses its basic noremaped behaviour.
2011-01-22 11:40:26	kennym	hi, what is the melodactyl project?
2011-01-22 11:41:04	kennym	it's not yet listed on the SF project page
2011-01-22 11:41:13	stepnem	kennym: Vimmy Xulmus abandonware.
2011-01-22 11:43:08	kennym	stepnem: thx, good to know
2011-01-22 11:44:51	John-Galt	iaj: No?
2011-01-22 11:45:47	John-Galt	It's not quite abandoned. I at least get it working again every month or so. :)
2011-01-22 11:46:38	stepnem	John-Galt: Oh, great. You never said so.
2011-01-22 11:46:59	John-Galt	Anyway, I'm currently having to deal with the horrible decision to give the FUEL library an app-specific contract ID despite it providing several app-independent interfaces...
2011-01-22 11:47:56	John-Galt	I need to find another way to get persistent app-global storage between restarts.
2011-01-22 11:48:37	John-Galt	Actually probably shouldn't be too hard.
2011-01-22 11:51:13	kennym	what is the easiest way to test changes you did to the Pentadactyl source code in Firefox?
2011-01-22 11:51:27	kennym	I am working off the hg repo
2011-01-22 11:51:36	stepnem	kennym: :h :rehash
2011-01-22 11:52:03	kennym	stepnem: awesome!
2011-01-22 11:53:42	kennym	Pentadactyl currently cannot know where my development branch is located. How can I specify the location?
2011-01-22 11:54:04	John-Galt	http://dactyl.sf.net/coding
2011-01-22 11:59:17	kennym	thanks, I got it working
2011-01-22 11:59:47	kennym	err... "got it working" or "got it to work"?
2011-01-22 11:59:58	John-Galt	Either way.
2011-01-22 11:59:58	stepnem	:-)
2011-01-22 12:00:53	kennym	Really? Good to know.
2011-01-22 12:00:54	kennym	thx
2011-01-22 12:23:12	kennym	is there a way to debug Pentadactyl?
2011-01-22 12:23:41	John-Galt	Uhm, yes?
2011-01-22 12:24:55	kennym	Venkman?
2011-01-22 12:26:03	kennym	A debugger like Firebug would be cool
2011-01-22 12:26:23	kennym	sorry, I don't know much about Firefox addon development yet
2011-01-22 12:27:33	kennym	ah! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077719/fastest-way-to-debug-firefox-addons-during-development
2011-01-22 12:29:55	John-Galt	Debugger is a rather vague term... There's Venkman and Chromebug, but I don't use them. There's JS evaluation on the command line and it's easy enough to trace code with dump statements.
2011-01-22 12:30:13	John-Galt	Debuggers are a royal pain in the arse, and the ones for Firefox just don't work very well.

2011-01-22 12:45:31	stepnem	Debuggers a royal pain in the arse? Depends on the language I guess... Being used to Emacs I miss a decent JS debugger very often.
2011-01-22 12:50:01	stepnem	Dump statements, if anything, are a pain in the arse. ;-)
2011-01-22 12:53:35	Chousuke	I guess dump statements are nice too when compared to a debugger like venkman. :P Maybe I just suck but I couldn't figure out how to use it effectively at all.
2011-01-22 12:54:10	Chousuke	and more often than not it would just get stuck :/
2011-01-22 12:54:11	stepnem	Yeah, me neither :-( But I gave up rather quickly.
2011-01-22 12:54:13	John-Galt	No, it's just crap.

2011-01-22 18:20:02	stepnem	John-Galt: Does that work? That's what I tried, the only difference being the quoted <bang>
2011-01-22 18:21:16	John-Galt	Yeah, that'd be the difference. The conditional has to be valid JavaScript. An empty string is false, a quoted bang is true. ! is invalid, though, and I suspect that an empty string wouldn't make :if happy.
2011-01-22 18:21:36	John-Galt	Yeah, get "Argument required"
2011-01-22 18:21:44	stepnem	Yeah. Thanks.
2011-01-22 18:48:24	stepnem	Um, it's annoying that MOW is not scrollable using the mouse wheel. It bites my every time I use :lc.
2011-01-22 18:48:36	John-Galt	Isn't it?

2011-01-22 18:56:44	John-Galt	Actually, yes I do.
2011-01-22 18:56:50	stepnem	Hm. I guess :bmarks suffers from #293 same as :history does.
2011-01-22 18:58:04	stepnem	They don't even complete any options at all. :-|
2011-01-22 18:58:19	John-Galt	Yes they do.
2011-01-22 18:59:40	stepnem	Ah, I see. It's just that you usually never actually get to them...
2011-01-22 18:59:50	stepnem	They should be put first IMO, at least after typing -
2011-01-22 19:00:24	John-Galt	They're supposed to be.
2011-01-22 19:00:33	John-Galt	Or possibly not.
2011-01-22 19:00:59	 *	John-Galt incidentally has autocomplete turned off for :hist/:bmarks, so...

2011-01-22 19:03:23	stepnem	BTW, approx. since yesterday I observe noticeable slowness in tab-cycling completions with my standard config, not so sure about +u NONE. Do you have any idea?
2011-01-22 19:03:57	John-Galt	Have you restarted your browser?
2011-01-22 19:04:10	stepnem	Yes.
2011-01-22 19:04:28	John-Galt	Donno then.
2011-01-22 19:06:07	stepnem	Another thing, shouldn't the empty completion kinds be elided altogether instead of showing an empty headline during completion?

2011-01-22 19:09:29	stepnem	Yeah, maybe it's just the display that's broken. I'll post a screenshot if that dratted page loads.
2011-01-22 19:10:45	stepnem	E.g. this: http://imagebin.org/133872
2011-01-22 19:11:08	John-Galt	Well, those aren't empty.
2011-01-22 19:11:42	stepnem	So it's intentional? I though it didn't use to be like this.
2011-01-22 19:11:46	stepnem	thought*
2011-01-22 19:11:57	John-Galt	Yes. It's always been like that.

2011-01-22 19:12:51	stepnem	OK. I think it's weird.
2011-01-22 19:14:07	stepnem	It's probably just that I don't usually notice due to my settings or something.
2011-01-22 19:14:43	John-Galt	Possibly.
2011-01-22 19:48:10	winn	pentadactyl is might awesome
2011-01-22 19:58:58	stepnem	I think I don't understand this TODO item: 8 <C-o>/<C-i> should work as in Vim (i.e., save page positions as well as locations in the history list).
2011-01-22 19:59:11	stepnem	Isn't that already the case with FF history?
2011-01-22 20:00:51	John-Galt	Huh? No, it means positions on the current page followed by pages in the history stack.
2011-01-22 20:01:03	stepnem	Oh, I see.
2011-01-22 20:09:35	John-Galt	God. You'd think that with Chrome doing so many extension-related things the Right Way it wouldn't be such a bloody minded hack.
2011-01-22 20:09:53	John-Galt	It gets so damned many things completely wrong.
2011-01-22 20:10:29	John-Galt	And then there's the fact that whatever JS you want running in the background has to go into an HTML document which will never be displayed...
2011-01-22 20:10:51	stepnem	Hm, this is the first time I hear it does extension-related things the Right Way.
2011-01-22 20:11:34	John-Galt	Well, in that extensions are all sandboxed, get explicit permissions, and are specification driven via a simple JSON manifest file.
2011-01-22 20:12:10	stepnem	I see.
2011-01-22 20:22:11	stepnem	Sigh. I still don't get why it was necessary to wrap the functions inside another function to fix #293.

2011-01-22 20:22:53	John-Galt	stepnem: Ah. Because the parsers get a second argument, which parseInt interperets as a base.
2011-01-22 20:26:07	stepnem	Ah... I was only looking at commands.js:397, there is also commands.js:894.
