2010-08-18 19:34:16	dev001	Is there a "Close all open tabs" functionality in Akregator?  I find "Close Tab" easy enough, but, with many open tabs it's endlesss-clicking ...

2010-08-18 19:47:28	Sho_	dev001: but of course a shared solution is work, which then isn't done, and so no feature ;)

2010-08-18 19:49:43	dev001	Sho_: imo, those issues belong in design guidelines up-front, ala: "If it's in KDE, and has tabs, then it should have CloseAll as implemented in/by Konquereor" blah blah
