2010-10-15 19:51:23	leo_rockway	KDE 4.5.2 works perfectly for me. There's one weird bug in klipper that shows 2 context menus, but that's it.
2010-10-15 19:52:08	Linuxhippy	leo_rockway: hmm, I didn't change it, I am still on elegance
2010-10-15 19:52:28	Linuxhippy	leo_rockway: I have ~40 open bugs I filed ^^
2010-10-15 19:52:43	windowshasyou	Kame2: I've been using kde 4.5.2 since its release, before that, I used trunk, and I keep seeing that everything is getting bigger and way more cpu intensive.
2010-10-15 19:53:20	windowshasyou	Its getting to a point to where if I run something like say, doom 3, I notice a huge drop in fps compared to using another DE like 3.xx
2010-10-15 19:53:21	Linuxhippy	windowshasyou: well thats the way software goes, if nobody works to counteract it
2010-10-15 19:53:29	thiago_home	no one does
2010-10-15 19:53:38	thiago_home	you can downgrade to DOS if you want the CPU to be barely used
2010-10-15 19:53:39	windowshasyou	I've shut off the desktop effects and still haven't seen any difference

2010-10-15 19:55:48	Kame2	windowshasyou: it is not that bad for all. but there problems with some graphic drivers that renders some things with cpu and such...
2010-10-15 19:56:06	windowshasyou	memory usage for me at least, slowly climbs to over 2 gigs when using nothing more than konversation, kopete, dolphin, and konqueror
2010-10-15 19:56:16	Linuxhippy	Kame: QT's X11 backend is *so* extremly bad, don't point your fingers to drivers
2010-10-15 19:56:35	Linuxhippy	it often doesn't give drivers a chance to accelerate stuff
2010-10-15 19:57:08	Linuxhippy	things like gradients, transformed blits even tiling are done by QT on the CPU
2010-10-15 19:57:21	Kame2	windowshasyou: there where a memory leak in 4.5.1 and before. and still is a cache in plasma that can grow up to 320mb (but not more). there are huge improvments in 4.6 in this regard
2010-10-15 19:57:35	windowshasyou	Kame2: Don't get me wrong, I'm a big supporter of kde and have occasionally submitted patches and such... its just getting to a point where I'm wondering if its worth it

2010-10-15 20:04:30	Linuxhippy	often there is simply no time to do extensiv profiling or memory allocation analysis
2010-10-15 20:04:54	Linuxhippy	I still think something like automated regression testing would be really great for KDE

2010-10-15 23:31:15	thiago_home	usually that's a driver issue, though
2010-10-15 23:31:16	miasma	ok, so it's a fundamental problem with X and nothing can be done?
2010-10-15 23:31:35	miasma	i use proprietary nvidia drivers so I guess I'm out of luck
2010-10-15 23:31:36	thiago_home	the memory is actually on the GPU and is simply mapped to RAM
2010-10-15 23:31:48	miasma	would running a 64-bit kernel help ?

2010-10-16 09:07:18	leahcim	Is it possible to change the height of the kickoff menu? It's kind of annoying that it's only half the hight of the screen.

2010-10-16 09:09:45	leahcim	a) that's tricky because the menu closes as soon as the mouse wanders outside the menu
2010-10-16 09:09:59	leahcim	and b) it goes back to its original size next time it's opened
2010-10-16 09:10:00	Sho_	that's not normal behavior
2010-10-16 09:10:28	Sho_	i should say: it's not default behavior
2010-10-16 09:10:34	Sho_	my guess is you have focus under mouse enabled
2010-10-16 09:10:39	leahcim	Yes.
2010-10-16 09:10:46	Sho_	so the cursor leaving the window causes a focus shift, closing the menu
2010-10-16 09:11:11	Sho_	can't reproduce it forgetting the size (4.5.2)
2010-10-16 09:11:53	leahcim	Actually, I lie. It resizes. I must've used alt-rightclick out of habit before
2010-10-16 09:12:42	Sho_	even when resized with alt-rightclich + drag it remembers the size across close+reopen here

2010-10-16 09:13:19	leahcim	o_O
2010-10-16 09:14:01	Sho_	doesn't surprise me, if i had to write it i'd hook up the storing of the new size to resize events, so both end up taking the same codepath
2010-10-16 09:14:11	leahcim	BTW I have focus-follow-mouse rather than focus-under-mouse
2010-10-16 09:14:59	leahcim	This is 4.4.5 (debian squeeze)
2010-10-16 09:15:07	leahcim	So perhaps the resize has been fixed.
2010-10-16 09:15:14	Sho_	quite possible
2010-10-16 09:15:41	 *	Sho_ goes check the svn log :)

2010-10-16 09:16:42	leahcim	The panel configuration also has the goes-away-on-defocus problem.
2010-10-16 09:19:05	Sho_	leahcim: i can reproduce the focus behavior with kickoff, but not with the panel deconfigurator

2010-10-16 20:47:26	thiago_home	how is that a KDE problem?
2010-10-16 20:47:43	Oleg_	because kde layouts are based on X layouts
2010-10-16 20:48:01	thiago_home	so tightvncserver has a problem that it doesn't support X properly
2010-10-16 20:48:06	thiago_home	that makes it a tightvncserver problem
2010-10-16 20:48:11	Oleg_	yes
2010-10-16 20:48:23	thiago_home	there's nothing we can do from the KDE side
2010-10-16 20:49:15	Oleg_	but you guys run kde on vnc servers a lot. how come no one in this channel told me that x11vnc actually does support xkb and therefore, supports enabling additional keyboard layouts?

It keeps trying to reatart, getting to the point where it shows the desktop for about a second, then segfaults and starts over agin. I don't even know where to start looking on this one, so any help greatly appreciated!

So I am running Debian Squeeze, KDE4 and Gnome.  I am presently using KDE.  For somereason Kwin crashed and had to restart.  I have 10 desktops, and the one I was on when Kwin crashed and restarted is now running Gnome.
2010-10-17 01:56:17	NOMADICUS	The rest are using KDE.  I think it is sort of cool, but definatly strange.  Also the pannel will only show on one desktop unless I make it hide.
2010-10-17 01:56:56	NOMADICUS	I would like to fix the pannel so that I don't have to hide it and that it will show up on all desktops.

I couldn't even escape to a different tty, anyway, now I can't run any kde application at all, they all give me Dbus errors! I really need to fix this, I don't mind using gnome as a desktop but I am very reliant on the Kate text editor where I do most of my work. Is there a way to fix this?

2010-10-17 09:10:16	Kalidarn	the second problem I've found is that there's not enough room or rather border on the clock and some text gets cut off for example it looks fine when the widget is unlocked like this: http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/9973/unlockedd.png but when it is locked it's very difficult to see the t http://img63.imageshack.us/img63/6040/cutoffclock.png

2010-10-17 10:04:00	Kalidarn	ah
2010-10-17 10:04:08	Sho_	and night in the us
2010-10-17 10:04:10	Kalidarn	hey Sho_ perhaps you can answer my question
2010-10-17 10:04:17	Sho_	i can try, what is it?
2010-10-17 10:04:20	Kalidarn	regarding some problems with the digital clock where would be the best place to talk about this what I think is a bug.
2010-10-17 10:04:31	Kalidarn	the first problem I've found sometimes when logging in (and using the Nimbus Sans L font) the clock looks like this http://img139.imageshack.us/img139/9288/borkedtextnimbussansl.png
2010-10-17 10:04:37	Kalidarn	the second problem I've found is that there's not enough room or rather border on the clock and some text gets cut off for example it looks fine when the widget is unlocked like this: http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/9973/unlockedd.png but when it is locked it's very difficult to see the t http://img63.imageshack.us/img63/6040/cutoffclock.png
2010-10-17 10:04:42	Kalidarn	the third problem I've found and (I'm using Kubuntu 10.10 with KDE 4.5.1) sometimes when I login I see a strange square http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/1867/strangesquare.png I'm wonddering if anyone else sees this strange square, seems the only way to make it go away is to log out or disable and then re-enable compositing effects

2010-10-17 10:05:31	Kalidarn	what distribution?
2010-10-17 10:05:41	Sho_	Fedora, KDE 4.5.x, nvidia blob

2010-10-17 10:06:29	Kalidarn	one of them is more a design problem, to do with spacing
2010-10-17 10:06:45	Kalidarn	the one with the overlapping text im not so sure about that is clearly not supposed to happen

2010-10-17 10:07:04	Sho_	Kalidarn: yeah. the strange square happens even with compositing off, so it seems to be internal to the plasma canvas. and the clock stuff looks like layout bugs (never seen them here though).

2010-10-17 10:14:15	Kalidarn	okay ill file both of those as bugs then on kde.org

2010-10-17 10:19:02	Kalidarn	yes u can do that.
2010-10-17 10:19:11	Sho_	meandrain: You can add a "Folder View" widget to the desktop and let it show any folder you want. You can also right-click the desktop and open the settings dialog from there, and then change the activity type to Folder View to have the desktop surface itself become an icon view. You can even combine the two by putting additional Folder View widgets on a Folder View activity.

2010-10-17 10:22:11	Sho_	meandrain: Do also explore the ability to use Folder View as a widget on top of the desktop, though (as mentioned that even works when Folder View acts as the desktop itself)

2010-10-17 10:22:32	meandrain	I see
2010-10-17 10:22:39	Sho_	meandrain: That way you can have multiple folders accessible from your desktop. You can even set Folder Views to filter on file type. And since this is KDE, they can even show FTP servers or whatever.
2010-10-17 10:22:45	Sho_	It's very flexible :)

I've talked to a number of people and we've discovered this bug only occurs in KDE4 with or without compositing effects (it makes no difference) it doesn't seem to happen in Gnome compiz-fusion. It happens with all 3 drivers radeon, intel and
2010-10-17 15:29:51	pinotree	... and your message was truncated
2010-10-17 15:29:58	Kalidarn	oh.
2010-10-17 15:29:59	pinotree	sorry no, i have no idea
2010-10-17 15:30:11	Kalidarn	I've talked to a number of people and we've discovered this bug only occurs in KDE4 with or without compositing effects (it makes no difference) it doesn't seem to happen in Gnome compiz-fusion.
2010-10-17 15:30:16	Kalidarn	It happens with all 3 drivers radeon, intel and nvidia proprietary it's been tested so it's obviously not a driver problem. I talked to the funman a VLC developer and he said that VLC uses the setWindowOpacity() method for handling transparency on VLC's OSD.
2010-10-17 15:30:37	Kalidarn	basically if it's not a driver problem, and it's not really a vlc problem as it works in other environments would it be able to be reported on bugs.kde.org?
2010-10-17 15:30:42	Kalidarn	perhaps it's a Qt bug
2010-10-17 15:31:03	Kalidarn	i'd need some help to further research it :(
2010-10-17 15:31:23	pumphaus	I'd rather think it's kwin then
2010-10-17 15:31:24	Kalidarn	as i'm not very experienced with developing with qt
2010-10-17 15:31:40	Kalidarn	yeah that's what was suggested also it's probably a window manager bug
2010-10-17 15:32:08	pumphaus	you could try again with metacity
2010-10-17 15:32:15	pumphaus	and see if it happens there as well
2010-10-17 15:32:22	pumphaus	if it doesn't, file a KWin bug
2010-10-17 15:32:23	Kalidarn	yeah i was using gnome and it works fine in that
2010-10-17 15:32:31	pumphaus	well, there you are :)
2010-10-17 15:32:34	Kalidarn	not metacity on KDE though
2010-10-17 15:32:43	pumphaus	that shouldn't matter
2010-10-17 15:33:01	pumphaus	file a bug for kwin. worst thing that can happen is that the kwin devs tell you this is not their fault.
2010-10-17 15:33:25	Kalidarn	i guess :)
2010-10-17 15:33:44	Kalidarn	what i might do is in my kubuntu vm that i have
2010-10-17 15:33:48	Kalidarn	use KDE4 and then kill kwin4

I'd like to change that. But I have no idea where to begin or better - which packages/files i need to download and which i need for test the changes.

2010-10-18 04:30:44	jaafar	recently I've noticed that maximized windows that are not on top will de-maximize (or "restore") when I click on their title bar
2010-10-18 04:31:02	jaafar	In previous versions of KDE clicking on the title bar would simply bring them to the front without changing their size
2010-10-18 04:31:25	jaafar	Anyone know if this is a recent change, and if so, whether it's configurable?  I would like to restore the earlier behavior. thx

2010-10-18 04:43:13	jaafar	sreich: good news - I don't know why this has anything to do with it, but I disabled everything under the "screen edges" menu and that de-maximizing behavior has disappeared.  Thanks!

2010-10-18 04:47:47	jaafar	I guess I don't see what either has to do with *not* de-maximizing an already maximized window which is not on top...
2010-10-18 04:47:53	jaafar	and yet, it worked!

2010-10-18 19:23:21	Candle	Hello, I'm using 4.4.5 from Debian and when I try to use the lock screen function (e.g. right-click empty space select "lock screen"), nothing seems to happen. I have looked around and seen several references to "kdesktop_lock" (which doesn't seem to exist); and various other commands that may have the effect of locking. Which command is the lock item trying to call? Which package would provide kdesktop_lock? What can I do to make this work?

2010-10-19 09:31:39	Gecko	hi there. I'm running kde 4.5.1, the kubuntu 10.10 default version, and since I upgraded to this version kde has switched around which monitor is the primary one and which one is the secondary one. I'm having an external monitor connected to my laptop, and use that as the primary one. I can set the right monitor to be primary with xrandr --output HDMI1 --primary, but my question is where kde gets it's idea of which monitor to make primary and if it's configurable?

2010-10-19 10:26:10	jorn	when i click on it it says:

2010-10-19 10:26:39	Mamarok	hm, it shows perfectly fine here

2010-10-19 10:27:00	jorn	in earlier versions when I clicked on the korganizer icon it started korganizer

2010-11-14 11:24:01	Nece228	i just thought that this bug is an answer to all those you complain about slow dolphin
2010-11-14 11:24:07	Nece228	is that so hard to understand
2010-11-14 11:24:48	pinotree	is that hard to understand that "slow dolphin" means exactly nothing and could have lots of different ways of causing it?
2010-11-14 11:25:04	Nece228	yes
2010-11-14 11:25:11	Nece228	but thats one of the reasons
2010-11-14 11:25:20	Nece228	why dolphin is slow

2010-11-14 11:25:57	pinotree	so it's just one issue of out many, not "an answer to all those you complain about slow dolphin"
2010-11-14 11:26:30	pinotree	it could affect many people, just like very few (and one being one of them)

2010-11-14 11:27:43	Nece228	what is community
2010-11-14 11:28:29	pinotree	let developers do their work, and triage their bugs, instead of deciding yourself what is important and what not
2010-11-14 11:28:44	Nece228	i dont complain like "change priority now", but you want to say that we dont care about you, we care only when many people vote
2010-11-14 11:28:59	Sho_	what pinotree is trying to say is that bugs.kde.org essentially serves two purposes: it is a way for you to file bug reports, but it is also a tool developers use to organize their work plans based on those reports. developers (may) use the priority field to organize what needs to be worked on first. so it is traditionally up to the developers to characterize the priority of a report, not up to the reporter.

2010-11-14 11:32:22	Nece228	pinotree: where did i say change the priority just because i hate this bug?
2010-11-14 11:33:04	Sho_	Nece228: in answer to that: If your account had the necessary access privileges to change the priority, then the priority info field would be a drop-down with multiple options to choose from and clicking the "Commit" button at the end of the form would save any change made in the drop-down

2010-11-14 11:33:23	Sho_	I don't remember off-hand if non-developer accounts can do that. If you don't have a drop-down, then the answer is no
2010-11-14 11:34:30	pinotree	Nece228: didn't want to change the priority because "i remember that how many people suffer from slow dolphin" and that "i said to make it higher because thats might be an answer to people who suffer from laggy dolphin"?
2010-11-14 11:34:47	pinotree	right, not for you, but because of "others"
2010-11-14 11:35:08	Nece228	Sho_, thats what i wanted to hear, thanks.
2010-11-14 11:35:50	Sho_	pinotree: well to be fair considering that reporters *can* pick high priority on initial submission (even when a developer may change it later), it's not exactly a totally far-out question to ask if it can still be changed just after submission (i.e. before any developer has re-prioritized)

2010-11-14 11:36:26	Nece228	its only time wasting
2010-11-14 11:36:40	Nece228	you didnt understood me, i didnt understood you
2010-11-14 11:36:48	pinotree	Sho_: don't remember you can choose priority on opening, just severity
2010-11-14 11:37:11	Sho_	hm, could be, I might misremember ... I always mix up severity and priority
2010-11-14 11:38:06	Sho_	yep you're right, the submission form only has severity
2010-11-14 11:38:24	pinotree	that's the new form, but iirc also the wizard didn't have it
2010-11-14 11:39:35	Nece228	nice talking to you, bye
2010-11-14 11:39:38	Sho_	so priority isn't changeable by reporters at any point actually (unless they have a dev account, then they can change it post-submission)

However,  after updating to 4.5.3,  I am not seeing that at all.  Widget still shows version 1.0   :(  Was hoping there was a way to get the latest,  seperate from my distro's Kde update.

2010-11-14 18:12:04	TheTrash	What could be wrong if KDE seems to be ignoring half of my anti-aliasing settings? I have it set to Disabled in System Settings but it's still anti-aliasing some fonts, but not all. Fonts that are still anti-aliased are e.g. taskbar / k-menu, window titles, but window contents and menus are non-anti-aliased, the way I want them to be.
