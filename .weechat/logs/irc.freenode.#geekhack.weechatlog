2010-11-21 21:46:21	dfj	run ahk with a script that starts the low-level redirect, then turn on the 'watch events'... I'll fire it up and give better instructions.
2010-11-21 21:46:47	dfj	this will tell us what the OS is seeing - I'm not suggesting using it to fix things.

2010-11-21 23:48:48	acfrazier	You guys should try my server, it's pretty lonely
2010-11-21 23:49:02	acfrazier	lemme reset the map though, it's pretty fubar'd
2010-11-21 23:49:08	dfj	we did - or rather notch did.
2010-11-21 23:49:25	dfj	wait - but my tree is here...
2010-11-21 23:49:44	dfj	if you reset the map, then there's nothing different about your server...
2010-11-21 23:50:27	acfrazier	It randomly generates a map
2010-11-21 23:50:30	dfj	theholyduck: log on and see if it fixed your stance ... nvm, it surely didn't.
2010-11-21 23:50:42	acfrazier	try ionnox.com in the IP field
2010-11-21 23:52:01	dfj	yes... I'll visit shortly, but the people and stuff they made is the 'server' really - you aren't running any mods yet either, so the only difference will be how well connected our two machines are to the net...
2010-11-21 23:52:38	acfrazier	My server is on a 100/100 line in Canada, so it should be pretty lag free for you
2010-11-21 23:53:11	dfj	and - has it been dead for a while? I would get some decent grumps from folks if I reset the map even now... :)
2010-11-21 23:53:38	acfrazier	Yeah, nobody's made anything, it was just me messing around
2010-11-21 23:53:57	dfj	ah, ok I'll stop by, then. :)
2010-11-21 23:55:43	acfrazier	2010-11-21 17:57:11 [INFO] holyduck lost connection: Internal exception: java.io.IOException: Bad packet id 64
2010-11-21 23:55:47	acfrazier	You broke my server, theholyduck
2010-11-21 23:55:49	dfj	heh.
2010-11-21 23:55:59	dfj	welcome to the duck's wire. :)
2010-11-21 23:56:02	theholyduck	acfrazier, i think i'm the server breaker
2010-11-21 23:56:10	theholyduck	apparently, i should find myself my own european servers
2010-11-21 23:56:19	acfrazier	either that or it went OOM
2010-11-21 23:56:22	acfrazier	my IM server just died too
2010-11-21 23:56:55	dfj	naw - it's just that the duck is a not very 1337 hx'r - he's just fuzzing our server's hoping something funny will happen.
2010-11-21 23:57:11	dfj	acfrazier: same VM?
2010-11-21 23:57:27	acfrazier	It's not running in a VM, this is a server in a datacenter in Canada
2010-11-21 23:57:37	dfj	java vm.
2010-11-21 23:57:38	acfrazier	I've known the guy for like 10 years
2010-11-21 23:57:40	acfrazier	ooh
2010-11-21 23:57:43	acfrazier	possibly
2010-11-21 23:57:48	acfrazier	openfire does indeed use java
2010-11-21 23:58:09	dfj	but - do you launch minecraft under openfire?
2010-11-21 23:58:26	acfrazier	No, but whatever he did crashed openfire too
2010-11-21 23:58:43	dfj	you certain - that ought not to happen.
2010-11-21 23:58:49	acfrazier	because when I went to restart it
2010-11-21 23:58:49	acfrazier	Shutting down openfire: /etc/init.d/openfire: line 134: kill: (18383) - No such process
2010-11-21 23:59:04	theholyduck	did i BREAK JAVA?
2010-11-21 23:59:05	dfj	right, but when did it go down?
2010-11-21 23:59:08	theholyduck	i am amazing!
2010-11-21 23:59:13	acfrazier	same time the minecraft server did
2010-11-21 23:59:35	dfj	what's your memory image like?
2010-11-21 23:59:51	acfrazier	I'm running with pretty limited RAM
2010-11-21 23:59:52	dfj	i.e. how much RAM do you have available?
2010-11-21 23:59:55	acfrazier	I think it's like
2010-11-21 23:59:57	acfrazier	3 meg free
2010-11-22 00:00:03	acfrazier	with all of this running
2010-11-22 00:00:10	dfj	out of... 2G?
2010-11-22 00:00:17	acfrazier	No, out of 380MB
2010-11-22 00:00:28	acfrazier	I pay like $10/month for this server
2010-11-22 00:00:29	dfj	erm - minecraft doesn't fit in that very well...
2010-11-22 00:00:39	acfrazier	Really?
2010-11-22 00:00:48	dfj	so - you likely ram out of physical ram.
2010-11-22 00:00:52	dfj	ran out.
2010-11-22 00:01:36	dfj	so - the jana processes started paging to disk, then started dropping packets like mad - breaking the programs.
2010-11-22 00:02:29	acfrazier	Yeah, because with just my IM and mail server running, I have 103632K physical ram free
2010-11-22 00:03:32	dfj	right - the others need to get swapped to run minecraft.
2010-11-22 00:05:21	dfj	so - stuff more RAM in that box - but at least make sure that the server command line does not have the normal suggested params - -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M - these mean use 1G of ram, minimum and maximum.
2010-11-22 00:05:55	dfj	if you have 384, then knock those down to 256 and the other procs will swap out, but hopefully won't die.
2010-11-22 00:06:55	theholyduck	lets put it like this
2010-11-22 00:07:00	theholyduck	most even half large minecraft servers
2010-11-22 00:07:03	theholyduck	have 4-8gb of rams
2010-11-22 00:08:06	dfj	(and that's a lot of sheep)
2010-11-22 00:12:36	sethstorm	hmm
2010-11-22 00:12:44	sethstorm	did the server go down?
2010-11-22 00:14:39	dfj	at some point, why?
2010-11-22 00:14:45	dfj	it's up now...
2010-11-22 00:15:15	dfj	(btw - found docs for the player file format - it will be easy to reset positions soon.
2010-11-22 00:17:00	sethstorm	ok
2010-11-22 00:17:23	sethstorm	dfj: I've managed to build some long tunnels, so dunno how that's affecting things
2010-11-22 00:17:39	dfj	no problem.
2010-11-22 00:17:41	sethstorm	roughly 400 units long
2010-11-22 00:17:49	dfj	srsly - not the problem.
2010-11-22 00:17:50	sethstorm	and with bridges in them
2010-11-22 00:17:55	sethstorm	ok
2010-11-22 00:18:14	dfj	it's packet bugs, due to notch not having good error control.
2010-11-22 00:20:00	sethstorm	that's why it's a bit slow at times?
2010-11-22 00:20:11	sethstorm	after it loads, it bogs down
2010-11-22 00:20:42	dfj	oh - give it time to pass all the blocks nearby to you before moving much...
2010-11-22 00:20:48	sethstorm	ok
2010-11-22 00:20:59	dfj	when you are outside you can see the scenery quickly load...
2010-11-22 00:21:06	dfj	on the web, it's not so quick.
2010-11-22 00:21:07	sethstorm	then it bogs down
2010-11-22 00:21:37	dfj	what do you mean bog down?
2010-11-22 00:21:49	dfj	how does it look from your end?
2010-11-22 00:22:13	dfj	I'm seeing connection reset exceptions from you.
2010-11-22 00:22:32	dfj	ok - you quit there.
2010-11-22 00:22:34	dfj	ah....
2010-11-22 00:22:42	sethstorm	forcequit the previous times
2010-11-22 00:22:50	dfj	and if you try to wait it out, it crashes?
2010-11-22 00:23:11	sethstorm	it's fine for 2-4s, but then it hits a wall of sorts
2010-11-22 00:23:19	dfj	...
2010-11-22 00:23:37	sethstorm	blowing away any apps that might cause it
2010-11-22 00:24:18	dfj	try starting with your view distance lower, then increasing it...

2010-11-22 00:50:56	dfj	heh, kk - I stare at the MC file formats a bit longer - they are actually documented by notch, so I can setup a respawn script shortly.
2010-11-22 00:54:49	theholyduck	is my state reset in such a way that i can join your server?
2010-11-22 00:55:47	theholyduck	seems so

2010-11-22 03:16:11	dfj	and - most of the dimensions are round numbers in fractions of an inch.
2010-11-22 03:18:36	Rezagrats	S5E18 - by far my most favorite.
2010-11-22 03:18:52	HaaTa	Topre board?

2010-11-22 03:23:24	dfj	that would be a schematic.
2010-11-22 03:24:03	Rezagrats	Well, i did kinda note that a couple minutes ago.

2010-11-22 03:25:47	Rezagrats	?*
2010-11-22 03:26:37	dfj	well - the lines are wires - where the wires cross they are _not_ joined, unless there is a dot too.
2010-11-22 03:27:15	dfj	but - one of the other diagrams will be a circuit board image which you could pay to have made somewhere...
2010-11-22 03:27:41	Rezagrats	What are the ||
2010-11-22 03:27:41	Rezagrats	?
2010-11-22 03:27:43	dfj	another file will be the list of parts... some of which you could skip, and some you will really need.
2010-11-22 03:28:29	dfj	the || are capacitors, the rectangles with a + in them are resistors... the triangles with two arrows off of them are LEDs.
2010-11-22 03:29:33	Rezagrats	How od i open a .eps file ?
2010-11-22 03:29:47	dfj	the single line __ 'GND' is the DC ground, and the multiple lines 'PE' are 'physical earth', i.e. the ground that connects to the case.
2010-11-22 03:30:11	dfj	.eps might be an eagle file, or it might be encapsulated postscript...
2010-11-22 03:31:03	acfrazier	encapsulated postscript
2010-11-22 03:31:04	acfrazier	is my bet
2010-11-22 03:31:26	dfj	eps will open in acrobat and ghostcript, etc...
2010-11-22 03:31:37	dfj	eagle opens in ... eagle.
2010-11-22 03:33:13	Rezagrats	The eps file doesn't wanna open in Eagle
2010-11-22 03:34:14	acfrazier	What's a cheap place to get a PCB fabbed
2010-11-22 03:38:37	Rezagrats	I knew grabbing a copy of photoshopPortable was a great idea.
2010-11-22 03:44:41	Rezagrats	http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/2649/89c2051pcps2parts.png
2010-11-22 03:44:49	Rezagrats	The "parts" file.
2010-11-22 03:46:47	Rezagrats	Now all i need to do is find all these parts.
2010-11-22 03:47:59	dfj	so - you can scrounge for alternates to almost everything there... I have something I could use for all of it excepting the chip you ordered online.
2010-11-22 03:48:34	Rezagrats	That image is heavily different that what kbdbabel has.
2010-11-22 03:48:41	Rezagrats	http://kbdbabel.sourceforge.net/pix/jpg1200/89c2051_pcxt2ps2_keyboard_top.jpg
2010-11-22 03:49:17	dfj	right - but you could just make that...
2010-11-22 03:49:25	dfj	from the schematic.
2010-11-22 03:49:29	Rezagrats	:\
2010-11-22 03:49:45	Rezagrats	But the issue here is that the maker himself screwed up.
2010-11-22 03:49:55	Rezagrats	The schematic differs from the product he made.
2010-11-22 03:49:58	dfj	what screwed up?
2010-11-22 03:50:07	dfj	product?
2010-11-22 03:50:24	Rezagrats	The image i last linked is the product made.
2010-11-22 03:50:40	dfj	he made a schematic - from that you can build something like what he did - leaving outthe bits you don't care about.
2010-11-22 03:51:06	Rezagrats	Like i know what bits i should care about- for all i know, everything there is needed.
2010-11-22 03:51:37	dfj	well - you could look at the photo and build that instead...
2010-11-22 03:52:05	 *	Rezagrats makes a note to hit up ebay.
2010-11-22 03:52:12	dfj	seriously - look at the photo, and try to figure out which parts you are looking at.
2010-11-22 03:52:30	Rezagrats	Flu, which file from sourceforge do i need for the chip's script.
2010-11-22 03:54:09	dfj	one thing that might not be obvious is that he replaced the inline resistor package with actual resistors he had on hand - so that's a difference from the diagram which you would want to copy - resistors are cheap and easy to find, but the multi-package ones are only cheaper if you need lots.
2010-11-22 03:54:38	acfrazier	what chip is that, by chance?
2010-11-22 03:54:41	Rezagrats	Where do i get the 24MHz thing?
2010-11-22 03:55:01	Rezagrats	At89c2051-24pu
2010-11-22 03:55:06	Rezagrats	Is what i have.
2010-11-22 03:55:07	dfj	that's a clock crystal, they are usually a buck or so - I get them at electronics stores. :(
2010-11-22 03:55:24	Rezagrats	"24MHz clock crystal" ?
2010-11-22 03:55:28	dfj	yeah.

2010-11-22 03:56:48	Rezagrats	About 50 cents each, shipped.
2010-11-22 03:56:50	dfj	you need the crystal, the two caps above it, and the big and little stabilizing caps...
2010-11-22 03:57:10	Rezagrats	The 33p thing?
2010-11-22 03:57:19	Rezagrats	There's a C1 and a C2 of them ?
2010-11-22 03:57:30	dfj	yup.
2010-11-22 03:57:46	dfj	33 picofarad caps - they help the crystal a lot.
2010-11-22 03:58:50	Rezagrats	What's the receptical for the main chip called?
2010-11-22 03:58:51	dfj	but - depending on what you have for cables and jacks - just use whatever if you have something that works - them bits are just to get the signals to the keyboard and computer, respectively.
2010-11-22 04:00:12	dfj	you might have a female 5 pin DIN from an old motherboard, but you might not - in which case you could look at how the XT's cable connects on the inside, and you are much more likely to have that connector on something.
2010-11-22 04:00:42	Rezagrats	I have an MMX board.
2010-11-22 04:01:14	 *	Rezagrats wanted the expansions cards more than anything else when he bought the computer for less than 5$
2010-11-22 04:01:15	dfj	If you were building a computer you'd be all mellow about how to fix a hard-drive in place so it was stable and looked good - but you'd also use what you had, if you lucked out....
2010-11-22 04:02:16	dfj	look at the picture again - it has way less parts than a PC.
2010-11-22 04:02:28	Rezagrats	...right...
2010-11-22 04:02:35	Rezagrats	What's your point ?
2010-11-22 04:02:51	dfj	my point is you'll be fine.
2010-11-22 04:03:22	Rezagrats	You never did answer my question about the receptical for the main chip.
2010-11-22 04:03:38	dfj	oh - 'chip holder' sorry.
2010-11-22 04:03:52	dfj	'socket' if you prefer.
2010-11-22 04:04:06	dfj	you'll have scads of them on old ISA cards and the like.
2010-11-22 04:04:47	dfj	longer is ok, wider requires breaking it in half and nipping out the middle.
2010-11-22 04:05:40	dfj	the goal is to solder the thing in rather than the bare chip so that 1) you can easily replace the chip if you wreck it, and 2) you are less likely to cook it while soldering.
2010-11-22 04:06:05	Rezagrats	Ha
2010-11-22 04:06:15	dfj	you could also build this into a $4-$5 solderless breadboard if you find one locally...
2010-11-22 04:06:22	Rezagrats	One of the GPUs you sent me has like 8 of them on it,
2010-11-22 04:06:46	dfj	yup - RAM sockets.
2010-11-22 04:06:58	Rezagrats	I'm not sure if i can get the solder off though.
2010-11-22 04:07:04	acfrazier	Radioshack sells solderless breadboards
2010-11-22 04:07:10	Rezagrats	They used very small amount of solder.
2010-11-22 04:07:13	dfj	btw - desoldering them will be important to get used to soldering, if you go that route.
2010-11-22 04:07:51	dfj	but - you can also torch the back while popping them off, if you are nimble.
2010-11-22 04:08:22	dfj	someone here reccomends shielding with tinfolk so you don't roast other chips, etc...
2010-11-22 04:08:31	dfj	aluminum foil.
2010-11-22 04:09:01	Rezagrats	Haha
2010-11-22 04:09:05	acfrazier	Tinfoil works for reflow, too
2010-11-22 04:09:07	Rezagrats	"tinfolk"
2010-11-22 04:09:17	dfj	then use a heat-gun or torch to get them wet.
2010-11-22 04:09:18	acfrazier	I can personally attest to that
2010-11-22 04:09:36	Rezagrats	Well, if i owned a hair dryer, it would work.
2010-11-22 04:09:42	Rezagrats	But i hate them things.
2010-11-22 04:09:45	dfj	ah, right - we were both on when the bloke suggested...
2010-11-22 04:09:53	Rezagrats	1800W is more than anything i've ever used.
2010-11-22 04:10:00	dfj	not certain a hair dryer is not enough... will it take paint off?
2010-11-22 04:10:10	dfj	hot enough.

2010-11-22 04:10:29	Rezagrats	I'm sure a n 1800W hair dryer will peel paint off a car.
2010-11-22 04:10:32	dfj	hair dryers are high-flow, a heat gun can blow less ahrd, with hotter air.
2010-11-22 04:10:48	dfj	ah - well, if you are _certain_, then I have my answer. :)
2010-11-22 04:11:08	Rezagrats	I know my mom has this 'crafting heat blower'
2010-11-22 04:11:22	Rezagrats	Worked well when i need to dry glue in less than 10min.
2010-11-22 04:11:40	Rezagrats	It also boiled the glue.
2010-11-22 04:11:59	dfj	right... so, my hair dryer is 1800W, but it doesn't set me on fire... (not that I have hair on my head anymore)...
2010-11-22 04:12:17	 *	Rezagrats makes a weird 'wtf' face.
2010-11-22 04:12:26	Rezagrats	Why would you have a hair dryer?
2010-11-22 04:12:41	dfj	but, my hot air gun is only a few hundred watts, but it goes to 700 degrees - it can melt aluminum.

2010-11-22 04:14:50	dfj	not as sad as me.

2010-11-22 04:15:47	dfj	heh.

2010-11-22 19:16:22	HaaTa	probably Black or MY
2010-11-22 19:16:37	HaaTa	if MY, then it's not really a good demo of a linear switch
2010-11-22 19:17:06	FabianS	Well. how loud are those cherry blues?
2010-11-22 19:17:08	HaaTa	MYs feel "mushy"
2010-11-22 19:17:10	HaaTa	hmm
2010-11-22 19:17:20	HaaTa	not loud (compared to say a Model M)

2010-11-22 19:18:07	HaaTa	(you won't mind, because you're typing)
2010-11-22 19:18:12	FabianS	Ok.. thats not really a problem..
2010-11-22 19:18:28	FabianS	It shouldn't annoy other people on skype
2010-11-22 19:18:35	HaaTa	lol
2010-11-22 19:19:12	HaaTa	well, since MX Blues are much easier to find in Germany (from what I hear), that's probably best
2010-11-22 19:19:23	FabianS	hm..
2010-11-22 19:19:25	HaaTa	you can always branch out and try others afterwards
2010-11-22 19:19:51	FabianS	I think das, cherry and filco are available as browns..
2010-11-22 19:20:10	HaaTa	yeah, but how available are they in Germany?
2010-11-22 19:20:18	FabianS	cherry and das no problem
2010-11-22 19:20:25	HaaTa	k
2010-11-22 19:20:30	FabianS	but the I heared the build quality of cherry is not too god
2010-11-22 19:20:32	FabianS	also no nkro
2010-11-22 19:20:39	HaaTa	Cherry quality is fine
2010-11-22 19:20:50	HaaTa	also, note that Cherry uses PCB mounted switches
2010-11-22 19:20:56	HaaTa	Filco uses plate mounted
2010-11-22 19:21:08	HaaTa	dunno what DAS uses (probably plate)
2010-11-22 19:21:24	HaaTa	the feel is noticeably different
2010-11-22 19:21:29	FabianS	Hm.. the razer is the cheapest one besides cherry
2010-11-22 19:21:59	HaaTa	also, I hate fingerprints, so that always cuts DAS and Razer from my list
2010-11-22 19:22:10	HaaTa	I don't really care about the USB hub
2010-11-22 19:22:16	FabianS	yeah
2010-11-22 19:22:24	FabianS	I don't need something like that
2010-11-22 19:22:41	FabianS	but the razer is like 80 euro
2010-11-22 19:22:49	FabianS	das 120 €
2010-11-22 19:22:53	FabianS	and filco >130
2010-11-22 19:23:00	HaaTa	yeah filco is a bit pricy
2010-11-22 19:23:23	FabianS	And I think you have to buy in UK
2010-11-22 19:23:24	 *	HaaTa has been to Japan to try out all the Filcos and such
2010-11-22 19:23:33	HaaTa	yup
2010-11-22 19:23:42	HaaTa	or you could get a RealForce
2010-11-22 19:23:45	HaaTa	but you
2010-11-22 19:23:49	HaaTa	ll need money for that
2010-11-22 19:23:50	FabianS	daaaamn expensive
2010-11-22 19:24:02	HaaTa	I have a few, and they are nice
2010-11-22 19:24:16	HaaTa	dunno about whether they are worth it for the price though
2010-11-22 19:24:18	FabianS	"a few"?
2010-11-22 19:24:23	HaaTa	2
2010-11-22 19:24:25	FabianS	How many keyboards do you have?
2010-11-22 19:24:29	HaaTa	one 30g Topre
2010-11-22 19:24:39	HaaTa	one uTron (bloody friggin expensive)
2010-11-22 19:24:55	HaaTa	hmm, I'm gonna do a count today, because I've lost track
2010-11-22 19:24:57	HaaTa	...
2010-11-22 19:25:31	 *	dfj suspects 'two' is an approximation of little accuracy.
2010-11-22 19:25:50	HaaTa	hehe
2010-11-22 19:25:50	FabianS	Hm.. black widow is not listed on amazon de yet.
2010-11-22 19:26:00	FabianS	Only at razerzone for 80 €
2010-11-22 19:26:02	HaaTa	well I plan on getting another Topre board in January
2010-11-22 19:26:43	HaaTa	picked up two more Keytronics today
2010-11-22 19:26:44	dfj	ah, two topres, sneaky. :)
2010-11-22 19:27:07	HaaTa	one with usb actually
2010-11-22 19:27:12	HaaTa	(and black)
2010-11-22 19:27:41	theholyduck	you guys and your money
2010-11-22 19:28:04	FabianS	Is there really any advantage in using PS/2?
2010-11-22 19:28:11	HaaTa	atm, yes
2010-11-22 19:28:16	HaaTa	true NKRO
2010-11-22 19:28:20	HaaTa	with no special driver
2010-11-22 19:28:21	FabianS	Well
2010-11-22 19:28:31	FabianS	show me how to type more than 6+4 keys at once
2010-11-22 19:28:33	HaaTa	otherwise, not really
2010-11-22 19:28:39	HaaTa	FabianS: exactly
2010-11-22 19:28:57	FabianS	I don't know if I need 6kro..
2010-11-22 19:29:19	HaaTa	only thing I really need it for, is the occaisonaly fighting game
2010-11-22 19:29:19	FabianS	Blackwidows seems to support all normal combinations.
2010-11-22 19:29:30	HaaTa	occasional*
2010-11-22 19:29:58	FabianS	I never had Problems with CoD or CS:S with my 2kro cherry
2010-11-22 19:30:13	HaaTa	yeah, typically FPSs are fine
2010-11-22 19:30:19	HaaTa	unless you like the uber combinations
2010-11-22 19:30:25	FabianS	yeah..
2010-11-22 19:30:39	FabianS	But I think the Razer is 6kro on wasd-cluster anyways..
2010-11-22 19:31:07	 *	dfj uses dfcv instead of wasd, easier on the wrists...
2010-11-22 19:31:35	AimHere	Can't say I've noticed any roillover problems for any keyboard for years, and the last time I did was llamatron, which used the cursor keys
2010-11-22 19:32:19	dfj	do you circle strafe with the keyboard, fine tune the aim with the mouse?
2010-11-22 19:32:36	FabianS	nope
2010-11-22 19:32:46	dfj	do you circle strafe?
2010-11-22 19:33:23	FabianS	I don't play quake
2010-11-22 19:33:34	AimHere	Well CS and CoD aren't really games you can circlestrafe in
2010-11-22 19:33:45	FabianS	maybe TF2
2010-11-22 19:33:57	FabianS	But I never noticed problems as scout
2010-11-22 19:34:03	dfj	heh - well - DOOM, but fast FPS games like it.
2010-11-22 19:34:30	AimHere	Yeah. It's better for games with fast movement and nonlethal weapons
2010-11-22 19:36:05	dfj	so, I map fc as forward back, dv as left, right, and sb as turnleft, turnright...
2010-11-22 19:37:58	dfj	I might be holding three of them down - which is fine on most boards as all will be on different columns except fc, which one doesn't need to hold at the same time.
2010-11-22 19:39:07	dfj	but - if I need to switch weapons, take a special action, etc... depending on where the key is matters now.
2010-11-22 19:39:27	-->	Scarzy (~Scarzy@host109-155-162-166.range109-155.btcentralplus.com) has joined #geekhack
2010-11-22 19:39:42	Scarzy	Evening brothers
2010-11-22 19:39:48	FabianS	I think I will wait till the Blackwidow is available at more shops
2010-11-22 19:39:56	FabianS	But the price is nearly unbeatable
2010-11-22 19:40:53	FabianS	G80-3000 costs 54 €.. ALso not bad
2010-11-22 19:41:10	dfj	which cherries are in the BW - blacks?
2010-11-22 19:41:15	FabianS	blue
2010-11-22 19:42:02	dfj	ah - them other games... RPGs, etc... they can eat up as many keystrokes as you like.
2010-11-22 19:43:32	FabianS	I've seen a SCII-Pro play with the lycosa
2010-11-22 19:43:33	AimHere	It's probably more likely to be arcade style games - fighting games and MAME and the like, that needs nkro
2010-11-22 19:43:42	FabianS	the worst keyboard I have ever tried
2010-11-22 19:43:59	AimHere	FPS has been designed so that the keys won't conflict on 99.9% of keyboards
2010-11-22 19:44:13	dfj	'FPS'?
2010-11-22 19:44:20	AimHere	FIrst Person Shooters.
2010-11-22 19:44:30	AimHere	Doom, Quake, Call of Duty, etc etc
2010-11-22 19:44:44	dfj	hmm.
2010-11-22 19:44:44	AimHere	I mean the default WASD layout
2010-11-22 19:45:19	dfj	k - move diagonally, with wd, then switch to weapon 3.
2010-11-22 19:45:42	dfj	or 2... etc...
2010-11-22 19:46:13	FabianS	Some friends of mine also don't have any problems with G15 or G11
2010-11-22 19:46:20	AimHere	I did try that on my Unicomp recently with Oblivion or similar, didn't have problems
2010-11-22 19:46:26	dfj	AimHere: what keyboard are you using?
2010-11-22 19:46:38	dfj	right now?
2010-11-22 19:46:48	AimHere	Well a week or two back
2010-11-22 19:46:58	AimHere	Might have not been weapon 3
2010-11-22 19:47:36	epeen	Weapon choice = mouse scroll
2010-11-22 19:48:01	dfj	if you are using wasd for movement, the numbers above them are unreliable.
2010-11-22 19:48:04	AimHere	Yeah, I generally mousescroll
2010-11-22 19:49:05	AimHere	Okay, rechecked and confirmed
2010-11-22 19:49:09	dfj	well - you were talking about defauld keymaps in 99.9% of FPS games...
2010-11-22 19:49:16	AimHere	They do lcokup
2010-11-22 19:49:18	AimHere	*lockup
2010-11-22 19:49:36	dfj	I'm saying the defauld of these well designed games, actually bork.
2010-11-22 19:50:52	FabianS	I also like using multimediakeys
2010-11-22 19:50:58	FabianS	thats also an advantage of the BW
2010-11-22 19:50:59	Scarzy	you will never need that many keys in FPS imho
2010-11-22 19:51:06	Scarzy	i've had input lag on the model M but
2010-11-22 19:51:08	Scarzy	that's about it
2010-11-22 19:51:17	dfj	oh? how much lag?
2010-11-22 19:51:40	FabianS	I get bored about all that lag-bullshit
2010-11-22 19:52:27	dfj	the keyboards have actual latency - but it is very small, I am always sceptical, but - it can be detected...
2010-11-22 19:52:44	FabianS	It takes like 100 ms until a mouseclick gets a reaction on the screen.
2010-11-22 19:52:45	Scarzy	No it does have lagg
2010-11-22 19:52:48	dfj	I'm very sceptical when folks claim one keyboard has less lag than another, though.
2010-11-22 19:52:52	Scarzy	wrong FabianS
2010-11-22 19:52:57	FabianS	nope
2010-11-22 19:53:03	FabianS	I've seen videos with slomo cams
2010-11-22 19:53:09	Scarzy	depends on what type of engine it is
2010-11-22 19:53:09	dfj	FabianS: that would be a problem with your game, then.
2010-11-22 19:53:14	Scarzy	what type of input it is using
2010-11-22 19:53:18	Scarzy	and what your hardware is running at
2010-11-22 19:53:23	Scarzy	mine does in 30ms iirc
2010-11-22 19:53:34	Scarzy	mouse runs at 2ms input lag
2010-11-22 19:53:38	Scarzy	with raw-input
2010-11-22 19:54:12	dfj	keyboards will be about 8, because of debounce time and PS/2 serialization.
2010-11-22 19:54:22	Scarzy	hmm
2010-11-22 19:54:23	FabianS	I haven't done the test
2010-11-22 19:54:23	Scarzy	yeah
2010-11-22 19:54:25	Scarzy	that's about right
2010-11-22 19:54:32	Scarzy	mice can get up to 250hz though
2010-11-22 19:54:34	FabianS	it was source engine with gtx 280 and quadcore
2010-11-22 19:54:40	Scarzy	(= 4ms delay)
2010-11-22 19:54:41	dfj	USB can shave about 1ms off of it, but it usually doesn't.
2010-11-22 19:54:45	FabianS	Mouse was logitech with like 1000 polling rate
2010-11-22 19:54:54	FabianS	The main Problem is the graphics processing
2010-11-22 19:55:04	Scarzy	but I guess depends on the input
2010-11-22 19:55:08	dfj	however - yes, the rendering can be really strange on some games.
2010-11-22 19:55:19	Scarzy	Ps2 is > than USB though I guess
2010-11-22 19:55:24	Scarzy	FabianS
2010-11-22 19:55:25	dfj	Oblivian, Fallout 3, etc... have horrible engines.
2010-11-22 19:55:25	Scarzy	what game bro?
2010-11-22 19:55:26	FabianS	Nope
2010-11-22 19:55:37	FabianS	Where is the advantage of interrupt-based?
2010-11-22 19:55:47	dfj	interrupt based?
2010-11-22 19:55:48	FabianS	Games use the key inputs only framewise
2010-11-22 19:56:09	FabianS	So there is no advantage of PS/2 to USB
2010-11-22 19:57:00	dfj	huh - I think there can be a ms or two off of 8, if the firmware is well written.
2010-11-22 19:57:20	FabianS	The total delay is over 60-80 ms anyways
2010-11-22 19:59:30	dfj	A full-speed USB keyboard is allowed to send updates every ms, so, 5ms to debounce gets you 6ms - whereas PS/2 must take at least 8ms to deal with any of the extended key releases - (extended forces an e0 prefix, and release an f0 prefix - plus the actual key, so 3 bytes - each takes about a ms to encode onto the slow serial PS/2 protocol).
2010-11-22 20:00:39	dfj	so - you found some game with 80+ ms delay - that doesn't exactly force other games to have such serious delays...
2010-11-22 20:00:59	FabianS	But its just logic
2010-11-22 20:01:06	FabianS	If the key alone takes 8 ms
2010-11-22 20:01:17	AimHere	Any game running at 50 frames per second will have of the order of a 20 ms delay just on general principles
2010-11-22 20:01:20	FabianS	GPU processing takes like 17 ms
2010-11-22 20:01:33	FabianS	output on the display again 17 ms
2010-11-22 20:01:35	dfj	60 frames per second, generally - almost all games.
2010-11-22 20:01:41	FabianS	+ all the cpu calculations
2010-11-22 20:01:49	FabianS	before the gpu can generate an image
2010-11-22 20:02:07	AimHere	I say 50 to simplify the arithmetic on handwaved calculations
2010-11-22 20:02:20	FabianS	I think more
2010-11-22 20:02:41	FabianS	Also most "2ms"-lcds are slower in fact
2010-11-22 20:02:43	dfj	the CPU gamerate will often be much higher than the video framrate - some games run at 200 ticks/sec, 100 is not rare - that's 5 and 10 ms, respectively...
2010-11-22 20:03:30	FabianS	The default tickrate of CS:S is 66
2010-11-22 20:03:39	dfj	so - the minimum time for a keystroke to get to the game engine is about 6ms, both for PS/2 and USB.
2010-11-22 20:03:40	FabianS	Normal for Counter Strike was 100
2010-11-22 20:04:28	epeen	Ah shit...
2010-11-22 20:04:31	FabianS	And the tickrate of CoD4 is in fact lower than the fps... It's like 30
2010-11-22 20:04:40	epeen	I hope to never forget lotion for my wrist.
2010-11-22 20:05:11	dfj	I'm going to neglect OS overhead, since recording the keystroke into the key-table in the kernel is very fast, as is the call from the game to retrive the table - usecs at worst, assuming mem-cache misses.
2010-11-22 20:05:22	AimHere	So does anyone disagree that the lag between the controller and the CPU is the least of your worries?
2010-11-22 20:05:35	FabianS	that's true
2010-11-22 20:05:44	FabianS	The graphic processing really takes most of the time
2010-11-22 20:05:57	AimHere	No gamer-optimising your model M by putting gold plating on the membrane contacts
2010-11-22 20:06:23	epeen	How about we don't give a shit until the issue becomes well over 500ms.
2010-11-22 20:06:31	FabianS	Gold has nothing to do with latency...
2010-11-22 20:06:40	AimHere	I know that. You know that
2010-11-22 20:06:52	epeen	FabianS: gold has by far the highest conductivity.
2010-11-22 20:06:55	AimHere	The people that make gamer keyboard probably know that, but it doesn't stop them putting silly shit like that on the box
2010-11-22 20:06:56	dfj	on an LCD, the refresh is usually 60 Hz, so that takes 16.7ish ms... but on a CRT, you can run at higher frequencies... over 200Hz, for example.
2010-11-22 20:07:16	FabianS	epeen: wrong
2010-11-22 20:07:19	dfj	gold plating on an M will increase debounce time. :(
2010-11-22 20:07:21	FabianS	Gold has a quite bad connectivity
2010-11-22 20:07:28	dfj	yeah.
2010-11-22 20:07:28	AimHere	"The use of PS/2 (combined with a gold-plated USB connector) and 18K gold-plated mechanical switches, means that SteelSeries 7G offers more Actions Per Minute than any other keyboard in the world, gaming grade response times and more than six times the durability of a traditional keyboard."
2010-11-22 20:07:29	FabianS	compared to copper and silver
2010-11-22 20:07:41	AimHere	Steelseries is probably a good keyboard but...
2010-11-22 20:07:48	FabianS	dfj: But crt images just suck
2010-11-22 20:07:51	dfj	that marketting blurb is lies.
2010-11-22 20:08:01	FabianS	If you see them in slowmo it's just blurry stripes
2010-11-22 20:08:02	dfj	FabianS: what?
2010-11-22 20:08:20	FabianS	I think CRT is quite a bad concept
2010-11-22 20:08:23	dfj	ah - I have had some pretty decent CRTs...
2010-11-22 20:08:34	Scarzy	FabianS
2010-11-22 20:08:46	Scarzy	I've played competative gaming for a long long time now
2010-11-22 20:08:52	AimHere	Well the Korean Pro Starcraft 1 scene still uses CRTs
2010-11-22 20:08:56	epeen	SteelSeries, Logitech, Razer, Fatal1ty are all shit for keyboards as far as i'm concerned- all i've seen are rubberdomes.
2010-11-22 20:08:58	Scarzy	and playing quake 3
2010-11-22 20:09:00	Scarzy	on 160hz
2010-11-22 20:09:08	Scarzy	is as smooth as a baby's bottom
2010-11-22 20:09:17	Scarzy	anything under 125fps is choppy
2010-11-22 20:09:18	FabianS	AimHere: As if it did any difference for RTS
2010-11-22 20:09:22	AimHere	Razer makes one Mechanical, and the recent Steelseries are mechanical too
2010-11-22 20:09:29	epeen	'cause Scarzy is always staring at a baby's bottom.
2010-11-22 20:09:30	Scarzy	125fps/135hz is beautiful
2010-11-22 20:09:33	Scarzy	:(
2010-11-22 20:09:36	Scarzy	that's not nice man
2010-11-22 20:09:38	FabianS	placebo ftw
2010-11-22 20:10:11	FabianS	I think that above 60 fps it gets near impossible to see differences
2010-11-22 20:10:22	AimHere	FabianS, those guys are flicking between different screens peaking at 800 times a minute, RTS is just as fast as FPS
2010-11-22 20:10:28	dfj	my point is that when the video latency falls to 6ms, the rendering to 2-3, then an 8 ms keyboard event is actually the slow part.
2010-11-22 20:10:41	FabianS	AimHere: US and EU-Pros all use LCD
2010-11-22 20:10:51	FabianS	dfj: thats way off
2010-11-22 20:11:04	dfj	you want me to write a demo for you?
2010-11-22 20:11:05	epeen	Who is this newfag anyhow?
2010-11-22 20:11:06	FabianS	I finally found the artivle
2010-11-22 20:11:09	FabianS	*article
2010-11-22 20:11:10	AimHere	Yeah, probably it makes little-to-no difference these days. Certainly CRT would have been better in the early '00s when Starcraft was first being televised
2010-11-22 20:12:10	dfj	FabianS: quote from the article's references - but I accept no experts in this rather fluff filled domain.
2010-11-22 20:12:37	dfj	These are my own numbers - I've been programming video drivers in assembly since 1989.
2010-11-22 20:12:43	FabianS	right
2010-11-22 20:12:46	FabianS	how realistic
2010-11-22 20:13:08	epeen	Believe him, he's old as fuck.
2010-11-22 20:13:25	dfj	I will not ask you to trust me on any point I make, but I expect you to support your statements, and I will mine.
2010-11-22 20:14:27	FabianS	They have a Video that shows 76+-6ms delay on TF2 with GTX-285 and a fast LCD
2010-11-22 20:14:53	Scarzy	FabianS you're wrong there too
2010-11-22 20:15:05	dfj	ok - I believe it, but it doesn't mean that other games need to be that slow...
2010-11-22 20:15:06	FabianS	Maybe goldsrc and quake 3-engines might be faster..
2010-11-22 20:15:08	FabianS	But not realistic
2010-11-22 20:15:16	Scarzy	saying that a difference in 60fps
2010-11-22 20:15:19	Scarzy	is placebo
2010-11-22 20:15:19	FabianS	TF2 is the same engine as CS:S
2010-11-22 20:15:22	Scarzy	really?
2010-11-22 20:15:38	FabianS	You might see slight differences on fast camera movements
2010-11-22 20:15:51	Scarzy	I think it might be LCD related perhaps
2010-11-22 20:15:58	Scarzy	because of the tearing
2010-11-22 20:15:59	dfj	depending on the settings, the same engines can be much slower or faster... with the exception of a few crappy engines.
2010-11-22 20:16:18	Scarzy	but 125fps/120hz
2010-11-22 20:16:26	Scarzy	compared to 76/75
2010-11-22 20:16:35	Scarzy	is so noticeable
2010-11-22 20:16:42	FabianS	Well.. Counter Strike Source is still nr. 2 in all esport games
2010-11-22 20:16:58	AimHere	I thought the esport community went back to 1.6 a while back
2010-11-22 20:17:04	FabianS	parts of it
2010-11-22 20:17:32	FabianS	but 1.6 will die
2010-11-22 20:17:39	FabianS	It's just too damn old
2010-11-22 20:18:26	dfj	You are familiar with persistance of vision - for most folks it kicks in between 50 and 70 fps, it's awesome when a game allows that.
2010-11-22 20:18:58	FabianS	I think that 60 fps are enough for almost everything.
2010-11-22 20:19:06	FabianS	120 is nice to have but nothing to big.
2010-11-22 20:19:14	Scarzy	I can not play games
2010-11-22 20:19:19	Scarzy	on anything but 100 or higher
2010-11-22 20:19:21	Scarzy	and never try to
2010-11-22 20:19:25	dfj	but - for detecting stuff, giong from 60Hz to 120 Hz will half the display latency.
2010-11-22 20:19:26	FabianS	yeah
2010-11-22 20:19:55	FabianS	But I think those differences are just too small
2010-11-22 20:19:59	Scarzy	Might be OK in other games but
2010-11-22 20:20:01	FabianS	even pros change from crt to lcd now
2010-11-22 20:20:10	FabianS	And they don't play all lowed out to get more fps
2010-11-22 20:20:10	Scarzy	yeah to the 120hz LCDs
2010-11-22 20:20:11	Scarzy	:p?
2010-11-22 20:20:13	FabianS	Nope
2010-11-22 20:20:16	FabianS	mostly 60 fps
2010-11-22 20:20:22	FabianS	because thats enough for them
2010-11-22 20:20:25	Scarzy	what game are we talking about here?
2010-11-22 20:20:31	FabianS	CSS, SCII
2010-11-22 20:20:34	FabianS	The newer stuff
2010-11-22 20:20:45	FabianS	Quake 3 as well
2010-11-22 20:20:51	FabianS	I have seen tournaments with LCD only
2010-11-22 20:20:54	Scarzy	I've only ever played CSS on 101
2010-11-22 20:20:56	dfj	and - if the game is well written, and your card is beefier than the game, then the degree to which it can outperform the needed calcs is the degree to which you can shrink the rending time between the game-rate and the display.
2010-11-22 20:20:59	Scarzy	quake3
2010-11-22 20:21:01	Scarzy	or quake live?
2010-11-22 20:21:04	Scarzy	Im a Quake3 engine man
2010-11-22 20:21:07	Scarzy	and I know for a fact
2010-11-22 20:21:19	FabianS	It was Quake 3 a game of fatal1ty
2010-11-22 20:21:21	Scarzy	that 76/75 on LCD is nothing compared to 125/120
2010-11-22 20:21:24	FabianS	But I don't care too much
2010-11-22 20:21:29	Scarzy	and online
2010-11-22 20:21:29	FabianS	because I don't like quake
2010-11-22 20:21:30	dfj	Q3 can be configured to run as fast as your video will allow.
2010-11-22 20:21:37	Scarzy	they will use LCDs
2010-11-22 20:21:44	Scarzy	dont think so man
2010-11-22 20:21:49	Scarzy	maybe they'll be forced to at lans
2010-11-22 20:22:00	Scarzy	but iirc, fatality has a horde of CRTs
2010-11-22 20:22:20	Scarzy	the games that I play use q3 engine
2010-11-22 20:22:24	Scarzy	and there are magic values
2010-11-22 20:22:43	Scarzy	(43, 63, 71, 76, 85, 101, 125, 163, 333)
2010-11-22 20:22:46	FabianS	But honestly.. Q3 is quite outdated
2010-11-22 20:22:54	HaaTa	that reminds me, I found a professional Viewsonic CRT today in the junk pile
2010-11-22 20:23:01	HaaTa	didn't pick it up though
2010-11-22 20:23:05	dfj	HaaTa: which one?
2010-11-22 20:23:11	Scarzy	less FPS will give you less recoil and less knockback on screen
2010-11-22 20:23:15	HaaTa	dunno, but the glass was flat
2010-11-22 20:23:17	Scarzy	but it will also lower your max packets
2010-11-22 20:23:27	Scarzy	which every other game will do too
2010-11-22 20:23:35	HaaTa	I can check tomorrow (it's been there for a while)
2010-11-22 20:23:36	Scarzy	higher the FPS, the higher the actual max packets output is
2010-11-22 20:23:41	Scarzy	Take it HaaTa!
2010-11-22 20:23:48	HaaTa	k
2010-11-22 20:23:55	Scarzy	want to see pictures of it too ;)
2010-11-22 20:23:59	HaaTa	it's probably 20"
2010-11-22 20:24:02	HaaTa	np
2010-11-22 20:24:07	HaaTa	I'll walk by tomorrow
2010-11-22 20:24:08	Scarzy	Where are you from?
2010-11-22 20:24:16	HaaTa	Waterloo (Canada)
2010-11-22 20:24:20	dfj	I have a couple've old 20" VS's... the one I really like needs tuning, or some new caps - but I don't know where to get it done.
2010-11-22 20:24:20	Scarzy	ah
2010-11-22 20:24:26	Scarzy	Craiglist it maybe if you dont like it
2010-11-22 20:24:31	Scarzy	im sure a nerdy gamer will want it
2010-11-22 20:24:44	HaaTa	I dunno if I want to carry back though
2010-11-22 20:24:50	HaaTa	it's a bit of a walk
2010-11-22 20:24:52	dfj	they are about 80 lbs.
2010-11-22 20:24:56	Scarzy	yeah
2010-11-22 20:24:57	HaaTa	yeah I know
2010-11-22 20:25:01	Scarzy	mine weights 29KG
2010-11-22 20:25:07	Scarzy	i have one that weighs 32KG :D
2010-11-22 20:25:07	HaaTa	I used to have 3 20" CRTs for my desk
2010-11-22 20:25:11	dfj	heh 19" :)
2010-11-22 20:25:12	Scarzy	what models?
2010-11-22 20:25:16	FabianS	I stay with LCD untill they fix the live expectancy of OLED
2010-11-22 20:25:45	HaaTa	I'll test the monitor tomorrow, to see if the picture quality is still good
2010-11-22 20:25:57	HaaTa	then I'll decide if I want some exercise

2010-11-22 20:36:32	FabianS	OLED would immediately end all fights betwenn LCD, CRT and Plasma if they didn't fade out so damn fast
2010-11-22 20:38:46	Scarzy	yo kishy
2010-11-22 20:38:54	kishy	hey
2010-11-22 20:39:24	epeen	Feels like i should stroke by thanksgiving.
2010-11-22 20:39:38	HaaTa	lol Double Shots is way to easy to write as "Double Shits"
2010-11-22 20:39:39	kishy	excellent
2010-11-22 20:42:06	epeen	Excellent that 'double shots' can mistyped as 'double shits' or that i feel like i will stroke after thanksgiving.
2010-11-22 20:42:08	epeen	?
2010-11-22 20:46:17	kishy	stroke.
2010-11-22 20:46:38	kishy	it's funny, seeing people on DX complaining that their 5 metre VGA cable doesn't work or gives poor quality
2010-11-22 20:46:51	kishy	i wonder why...maybe it's because VGA cables have to be short to maintain signal...
2010-11-22 20:48:51	FabianS	Who uses VGA?
2010-11-22 20:49:25	kishy	me? a massive number of people whose laptops only have VGA out? people whose monitor only has VGA in?
2010-11-22 20:49:29	FabianS	I think its very funny to see HDMI-cables for > 200 dollar
2010-11-22 20:49:36	kishy	these people are still, i'd venture to say, the majority
2010-11-22 20:49:49	FabianS	All good displays have digital input
2010-11-22 20:50:12	kishy	fairly sure off the shelf PCs are still shipping with VGA-equipped gfx cards/onboard video
2010-11-22 20:50:22	bhtooefr	and the other thing is, DVI is a HUGE connector
2010-11-22 20:50:23	kishy	and so even if the display has DVI/HDMI, they use VGA
2010-11-22 20:50:41	bhtooefr	so it's unpopular on anything that's not workstation/gamer class
2010-11-22 20:50:46	bhtooefr	HDMI, that's gaining traction
2010-11-22 20:50:57	FabianS	I see VGA only on beamers
2010-11-22 20:50:58	kishy	i have DVI on both my desktop gfx card and my monitor
2010-11-22 20:50:58	bhtooefr	DisplayPort is gaining more traction, simply because it's a small connector that has no licensing fees
2010-11-22 20:51:02	FabianS	or ancient displays
2010-11-22 20:51:06	kishy	but i use VGA because i can't be assed to buy a cable
2010-11-22 20:51:15	bhtooefr	FabianS: and that's another reason, laptops MUST have VGA for those
2010-11-22 20:51:26	bhtooefr	and dongles are only acceptable to Mac users
2010-11-22 20:51:38	epeen	My GPU is dying and i can't do dual screen any more. :\
2010-11-22 20:51:38	kishy	lol @ mini DVI or whatever it's called
2010-11-22 20:51:51	FabianS	I also have dual screen with 2xDVI
2010-11-22 20:52:06	FabianS	Its just so non-sense to convert a digital image in analog and back to digial
2010-11-22 20:52:22	bhtooefr	kishy: oh, now they're using mini displayport
2010-11-22 20:52:40	kishy	this is true, FabianS
2010-11-22 20:52:46	bhtooefr	anyway, of my primary computers... NONE of them have a DVI port accessible without docking
2010-11-22 20:52:46	epeen	My GPU has been pushing to do barely 720p video and after 20min, i gotta wait and restart the video in the place i left off.
2010-11-22 20:52:46	kishy	but it comes down to cost i'm sure...
2010-11-22 20:52:54	bhtooefr	netbook just has VGA
2010-11-22 20:52:56	kishy	and like i said off the shelf systems are usually shipping with VGA
2010-11-22 20:53:12	bhtooefr	ThinkPad has VGA, if I dock in a port rep, I get 1x VGA and 1x DVI
2010-11-22 20:53:32	bhtooefr	if I dock in an Advanced Dock, I can get as many DVI (or HDMI, or DisplayPort, or whatever) as I can get on a single-slot 50W GPU
2010-11-22 20:53:35	FabianS	My ThinkPad has VGA only
2010-11-22 20:53:45	bhtooefr	plus 1x DVI and 1x VGA
2010-11-22 20:53:46	FabianS	But only use that for projectors
2010-11-22 20:53:58	bhtooefr	what model is it?
2010-11-22 20:54:03	FabianS	the cheap one
2010-11-22 20:54:06	FabianS	x100e
2010-11-22 20:54:10	bhtooefr	there's quite a few cheap ones
2010-11-22 20:54:11	bhtooefr	oh
2010-11-22 20:54:14	bhtooefr	yeah, that won't dock
2010-11-22 20:54:15	epeen	My netbook has the best output for my CRT- >1800x1300
2010-11-22 20:54:18	FabianS	yep
2010-11-22 20:54:28	 *	epeen goes back to work
2010-11-22 20:54:41	FabianS	It was the only subnotebook without glossy screen under 1000 €
2010-11-22 20:54:42	bhtooefr	hopefully DisplayPort takes hold, and gets rid of VGA for good
2010-11-22 20:55:17	bhtooefr	there are some 1366x768 10.1" Atom ones with matte out there
2010-11-22 20:55:24	bhtooefr	I intend to swap such a panel into my netbook
2010-11-22 20:56:58	FabianS	bhtooefr: Those models are out for like one or two months
2010-11-22 20:57:23	FabianS	Before you only hat the choice between low resolution or glossy screen
2010-11-22 20:57:54	bhtooefr	my netbook currently has 1024x600 glossy :(
2010-11-22 20:58:01	bhtooefr	glossy is cheaper, that's why it's so common
2010-11-22 20:58:06	FabianS	no
2010-11-22 20:58:07	bhtooefr	they get away with leaving off the top layer of the panel
2010-11-22 20:58:12	FabianS	It is not cheaper
2010-11-22 20:58:15	FabianS	maybe a few cent
2010-11-22 20:58:27	bhtooefr	a few cents times a few million units = a lot cheaper
2010-11-22 20:58:32	FabianS	Not rally
2010-11-22 20:58:39	bhtooefr	let's say it's 10 cents cheaper
2010-11-22 20:58:43	bhtooefr	and they make 5 million panels
2010-11-22 20:58:48	FabianS	It's less than 10 ct.
2010-11-22 20:58:52	FabianS	more like 1 ct
2010-11-22 20:59:02	FabianS	glossy screens are marketing solelly
2010-11-22 20:59:10	bhtooefr	that's $500,000
2010-11-22 20:59:17	bhtooefr	OK, at 1 cent, that's still $50,000
2010-11-22 20:59:37	MorningSong	my netbook is matte :D
2010-11-22 20:59:39	FabianS	Peanuts
2010-11-22 20:59:43	bhtooefr	and at Chinese profit margins, 1 cent is a LOT
2010-11-22 20:59:57	FabianS	It has zero economic reason
2010-11-22 21:00:17	FabianS	The only reason for glossy screens is crappy marketing
2010-11-22 21:00:30	bhtooefr	the Chinese will fight like hell over 1 cent in the power adapter
2010-11-22 21:00:40	bhtooefr	anywhere they can shave pennies off, the better
2010-11-22 21:00:49	FabianS	Still it is not a reason
2010-11-22 21:00:58	bhtooefr	on low-end laptops, there's no profit margin
2010-11-22 21:00:59	FabianS	The costs are pretty equal
2010-11-22 21:01:01	bhtooefr	hence going after pennies
2010-11-22 21:01:19	bhtooefr	a netbook that sells for $250 costs about $240 to build, IIRC
2010-11-22 21:01:20	FabianS	Thats wron
2010-11-22 21:01:25	FabianS	on the screens
2010-11-22 21:01:36	FabianS	They have never made glossy screens for cost reduction
2010-11-22 21:02:37	FabianS	thats and old but sticky rumour
2010-11-22 21:02:39	FabianS	thats plain wrong
2010-11-22 21:03:00	bhtooefr	we've been TOLD it's for marketing reasons, but nobody actually likes glossy screens
2010-11-22 21:03:08	FabianS	sure?
2010-11-22 21:03:27	bhtooefr	so the only logical explanation is cost
2010-11-22 21:03:32	FabianS	No
2010-11-22 21:03:36	bhtooefr	and they market to hide the cost explanation
2010-11-22 21:03:40	FabianS	No
2010-11-22 21:03:47	FabianS	That explanation is plain wrong
2010-11-22 21:03:52	FabianS	there is no real cost difference
2010-11-22 21:03:55	bhtooefr	and if they can get additional profit margin out of it, they wi
2010-11-22 21:03:56	bhtooefr	win*
2010-11-22 21:04:00	FabianS	NO
2010-11-22 21:04:05	FabianS	That is wrong
2010-11-22 21:04:10	bhtooefr	OK, answer this for me.
2010-11-22 21:04:25	bhtooefr	why is it impossible to get a bottom-of-the-line system with a matte display?
2010-11-22 21:04:35	bhtooefr	why do you have to step up at least $20-50 to get matte?
2010-11-22 21:04:38	FabianS	because they sell besser with glossy displays

2010-11-22 21:05:15	FabianS	the people who actually know that matte displays are better are a small minority
2010-11-22 21:05:32	FabianS	The biggest group of consumer will buy the most bling bling product
2010-11-22 21:05:53	FabianS	That's also why apple makes all their crappy screens glossy
2010-11-22 21:08:05	kishy	matte i feel is also better as the display ages
2010-11-22 21:08:19	kishy	my laptop LCD is pretty much at the end of its life. very dim, damage in the corner
2010-11-22 21:08:29	FabianS	Apple even places an extra-glossy layer on top of their screens
2010-11-22 21:08:32	kishy	but because it's matte, i can still see it in light
2010-11-22 21:08:39	FabianS	so it's in fact more expensive
2010-11-22 21:08:42	FabianS	than a matte display
2010-11-22 21:09:02	bhtooefr	of course, then you get high-quality IPS displays, which screw all of that up by running an extra-thin matte layer
2010-11-22 21:09:11	bhtooefr	making them semi-glossy
2010-11-22 21:09:18	bhtooefr	(because thick layers cause a rainbow sparkle effect
