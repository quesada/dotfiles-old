2010-11-21 21:46:21	dfj	run ahk with a script that starts the low-level redirect, then turn on the 'watch events'... I'll fire it up and give better instructions.
2010-11-21 21:46:47	dfj	this will tell us what the OS is seeing - I'm not suggesting using it to fix things.

2010-11-21 23:48:48	acfrazier	You guys should try my server, it's pretty lonely
2010-11-21 23:49:02	acfrazier	lemme reset the map though, it's pretty fubar'd
2010-11-21 23:49:08	dfj	we did - or rather notch did.
2010-11-21 23:49:25	dfj	wait - but my tree is here...
2010-11-21 23:49:44	dfj	if you reset the map, then there's nothing different about your server...
2010-11-21 23:50:27	acfrazier	It randomly generates a map
2010-11-21 23:50:30	dfj	theholyduck: log on and see if it fixed your stance ... nvm, it surely didn't.
2010-11-21 23:50:42	acfrazier	try ionnox.com in the IP field
2010-11-21 23:52:01	dfj	yes... I'll visit shortly, but the people and stuff they made is the 'server' really - you aren't running any mods yet either, so the only difference will be how well connected our two machines are to the net...
2010-11-21 23:52:38	acfrazier	My server is on a 100/100 line in Canada, so it should be pretty lag free for you
2010-11-21 23:53:11	dfj	and - has it been dead for a while? I would get some decent grumps from folks if I reset the map even now... :)
2010-11-21 23:53:38	acfrazier	Yeah, nobody's made anything, it was just me messing around
2010-11-21 23:53:57	dfj	ah, ok I'll stop by, then. :)
2010-11-21 23:55:43	acfrazier	2010-11-21 17:57:11 [INFO] holyduck lost connection: Internal exception: java.io.IOException: Bad packet id 64
2010-11-21 23:55:47	acfrazier	You broke my server, theholyduck
2010-11-21 23:55:49	dfj	heh.
2010-11-21 23:55:59	dfj	welcome to the duck's wire. :)
2010-11-21 23:56:02	theholyduck	acfrazier, i think i'm the server breaker
2010-11-21 23:56:10	theholyduck	apparently, i should find myself my own european servers
2010-11-21 23:56:19	acfrazier	either that or it went OOM
2010-11-21 23:56:22	acfrazier	my IM server just died too
2010-11-21 23:56:55	dfj	naw - it's just that the duck is a not very 1337 hx'r - he's just fuzzing our server's hoping something funny will happen.
2010-11-21 23:57:11	dfj	acfrazier: same VM?
2010-11-21 23:57:27	acfrazier	It's not running in a VM, this is a server in a datacenter in Canada
2010-11-21 23:57:37	dfj	java vm.
2010-11-21 23:57:38	acfrazier	I've known the guy for like 10 years
2010-11-21 23:57:40	acfrazier	ooh
2010-11-21 23:57:43	acfrazier	possibly
2010-11-21 23:57:48	acfrazier	openfire does indeed use java
2010-11-21 23:58:09	dfj	but - do you launch minecraft under openfire?
2010-11-21 23:58:26	acfrazier	No, but whatever he did crashed openfire too
2010-11-21 23:58:43	dfj	you certain - that ought not to happen.
2010-11-21 23:58:49	acfrazier	because when I went to restart it
2010-11-21 23:58:49	acfrazier	Shutting down openfire: /etc/init.d/openfire: line 134: kill: (18383) - No such process
2010-11-21 23:59:04	theholyduck	did i BREAK JAVA?
2010-11-21 23:59:05	dfj	right, but when did it go down?
2010-11-21 23:59:08	theholyduck	i am amazing!
2010-11-21 23:59:13	acfrazier	same time the minecraft server did
2010-11-21 23:59:35	dfj	what's your memory image like?
2010-11-21 23:59:51	acfrazier	I'm running with pretty limited RAM
2010-11-21 23:59:52	dfj	i.e. how much RAM do you have available?
2010-11-21 23:59:55	acfrazier	I think it's like
2010-11-21 23:59:57	acfrazier	3 meg free
2010-11-22 00:00:03	acfrazier	with all of this running
2010-11-22 00:00:10	dfj	out of... 2G?
2010-11-22 00:00:17	acfrazier	No, out of 380MB
2010-11-22 00:00:28	acfrazier	I pay like $10/month for this server
2010-11-22 00:00:29	dfj	erm - minecraft doesn't fit in that very well...
2010-11-22 00:00:39	acfrazier	Really?
2010-11-22 00:00:48	dfj	so - you likely ram out of physical ram.
2010-11-22 00:00:52	dfj	ran out.
2010-11-22 00:01:36	dfj	so - the jana processes started paging to disk, then started dropping packets like mad - breaking the programs.
2010-11-22 00:02:29	acfrazier	Yeah, because with just my IM and mail server running, I have 103632K physical ram free
2010-11-22 00:03:32	dfj	right - the others need to get swapped to run minecraft.
2010-11-22 00:05:21	dfj	so - stuff more RAM in that box - but at least make sure that the server command line does not have the normal suggested params - -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M - these mean use 1G of ram, minimum and maximum.
2010-11-22 00:05:55	dfj	if you have 384, then knock those down to 256 and the other procs will swap out, but hopefully won't die.
2010-11-22 00:06:55	theholyduck	lets put it like this
2010-11-22 00:07:00	theholyduck	most even half large minecraft servers
2010-11-22 00:07:03	theholyduck	have 4-8gb of rams
2010-11-22 00:08:06	dfj	(and that's a lot of sheep)
2010-11-22 00:12:36	sethstorm	hmm
2010-11-22 00:12:44	sethstorm	did the server go down?
2010-11-22 00:14:39	dfj	at some point, why?
2010-11-22 00:14:45	dfj	it's up now...
2010-11-22 00:15:15	dfj	(btw - found docs for the player file format - it will be easy to reset positions soon.
2010-11-22 00:17:00	sethstorm	ok
2010-11-22 00:17:23	sethstorm	dfj: I've managed to build some long tunnels, so dunno how that's affecting things
2010-11-22 00:17:39	dfj	no problem.
2010-11-22 00:17:41	sethstorm	roughly 400 units long
2010-11-22 00:17:49	dfj	srsly - not the problem.
2010-11-22 00:17:50	sethstorm	and with bridges in them
2010-11-22 00:17:55	sethstorm	ok
2010-11-22 00:18:14	dfj	it's packet bugs, due to notch not having good error control.
2010-11-22 00:20:00	sethstorm	that's why it's a bit slow at times?
2010-11-22 00:20:11	sethstorm	after it loads, it bogs down
2010-11-22 00:20:42	dfj	oh - give it time to pass all the blocks nearby to you before moving much...
2010-11-22 00:20:48	sethstorm	ok
2010-11-22 00:20:59	dfj	when you are outside you can see the scenery quickly load...
2010-11-22 00:21:06	dfj	on the web, it's not so quick.
2010-11-22 00:21:07	sethstorm	then it bogs down
2010-11-22 00:21:37	dfj	what do you mean bog down?
2010-11-22 00:21:49	dfj	how does it look from your end?
2010-11-22 00:22:13	dfj	I'm seeing connection reset exceptions from you.
2010-11-22 00:22:32	dfj	ok - you quit there.
2010-11-22 00:22:34	dfj	ah....
2010-11-22 00:22:42	sethstorm	forcequit the previous times
2010-11-22 00:22:50	dfj	and if you try to wait it out, it crashes?
2010-11-22 00:23:11	sethstorm	it's fine for 2-4s, but then it hits a wall of sorts
2010-11-22 00:23:19	dfj	...
2010-11-22 00:23:37	sethstorm	blowing away any apps that might cause it
2010-11-22 00:24:18	dfj	try starting with your view distance lower, then increasing it...

2010-11-22 00:50:56	dfj	heh, kk - I stare at the MC file formats a bit longer - they are actually documented by notch, so I can setup a respawn script shortly.
2010-11-22 00:54:49	theholyduck	is my state reset in such a way that i can join your server?
2010-11-22 00:55:47	theholyduck	seems so

2010-11-22 03:16:11	dfj	and - most of the dimensions are round numbers in fractions of an inch.
2010-11-22 03:18:36	Rezagrats	S5E18 - by far my most favorite.
2010-11-22 03:18:52	HaaTa	Topre board?

2010-11-22 03:23:24	dfj	that would be a schematic.
2010-11-22 03:24:03	Rezagrats	Well, i did kinda note that a couple minutes ago.

2010-11-22 03:25:47	Rezagrats	?*
2010-11-22 03:26:37	dfj	well - the lines are wires - where the wires cross they are _not_ joined, unless there is a dot too.
2010-11-22 03:27:15	dfj	but - one of the other diagrams will be a circuit board image which you could pay to have made somewhere...
2010-11-22 03:27:41	Rezagrats	What are the ||
2010-11-22 03:27:41	Rezagrats	?
2010-11-22 03:27:43	dfj	another file will be the list of parts... some of which you could skip, and some you will really need.
2010-11-22 03:28:29	dfj	the || are capacitors, the rectangles with a + in them are resistors... the triangles with two arrows off of them are LEDs.
2010-11-22 03:29:33	Rezagrats	How od i open a .eps file ?
2010-11-22 03:29:47	dfj	the single line __ 'GND' is the DC ground, and the multiple lines 'PE' are 'physical earth', i.e. the ground that connects to the case.
2010-11-22 03:30:11	dfj	.eps might be an eagle file, or it might be encapsulated postscript...
2010-11-22 03:31:03	acfrazier	encapsulated postscript
2010-11-22 03:31:04	acfrazier	is my bet
2010-11-22 03:31:26	dfj	eps will open in acrobat and ghostcript, etc...
2010-11-22 03:31:37	dfj	eagle opens in ... eagle.
2010-11-22 03:33:13	Rezagrats	The eps file doesn't wanna open in Eagle
2010-11-22 03:34:14	acfrazier	What's a cheap place to get a PCB fabbed
2010-11-22 03:38:37	Rezagrats	I knew grabbing a copy of photoshopPortable was a great idea.
2010-11-22 03:44:41	Rezagrats	http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/2649/89c2051pcps2parts.png
2010-11-22 03:44:49	Rezagrats	The "parts" file.
2010-11-22 03:46:47	Rezagrats	Now all i need to do is find all these parts.
2010-11-22 03:47:59	dfj	so - you can scrounge for alternates to almost everything there... I have something I could use for all of it excepting the chip you ordered online.
2010-11-22 03:48:34	Rezagrats	That image is heavily different that what kbdbabel has.
2010-11-22 03:48:41	Rezagrats	http://kbdbabel.sourceforge.net/pix/jpg1200/89c2051_pcxt2ps2_keyboard_top.jpg
2010-11-22 03:49:17	dfj	right - but you could just make that...
2010-11-22 03:49:25	dfj	from the schematic.
2010-11-22 03:49:29	Rezagrats	:\
2010-11-22 03:49:45	Rezagrats	But the issue here is that the maker himself screwed up.
2010-11-22 03:49:55	Rezagrats	The schematic differs from the product he made.
2010-11-22 03:49:58	dfj	what screwed up?
2010-11-22 03:50:07	dfj	product?
2010-11-22 03:50:24	Rezagrats	The image i last linked is the product made.
2010-11-22 03:50:40	dfj	he made a schematic - from that you can build something like what he did - leaving outthe bits you don't care about.
2010-11-22 03:51:06	Rezagrats	Like i know what bits i should care about- for all i know, everything there is needed.
2010-11-22 03:51:37	dfj	well - you could look at the photo and build that instead...
2010-11-22 03:52:05	 *	Rezagrats makes a note to hit up ebay.
2010-11-22 03:52:12	dfj	seriously - look at the photo, and try to figure out which parts you are looking at.
2010-11-22 03:52:30	Rezagrats	Flu, which file from sourceforge do i need for the chip's script.
2010-11-22 03:54:09	dfj	one thing that might not be obvious is that he replaced the inline resistor package with actual resistors he had on hand - so that's a difference from the diagram which you would want to copy - resistors are cheap and easy to find, but the multi-package ones are only cheaper if you need lots.
2010-11-22 03:54:38	acfrazier	what chip is that, by chance?
2010-11-22 03:54:41	Rezagrats	Where do i get the 24MHz thing?
2010-11-22 03:55:01	Rezagrats	At89c2051-24pu
2010-11-22 03:55:06	Rezagrats	Is what i have.
2010-11-22 03:55:07	dfj	that's a clock crystal, they are usually a buck or so - I get them at electronics stores. :(
2010-11-22 03:55:24	Rezagrats	"24MHz clock crystal" ?
2010-11-22 03:55:28	dfj	yeah.

2010-11-22 03:56:48	Rezagrats	About 50 cents each, shipped.
2010-11-22 03:56:50	dfj	you need the crystal, the two caps above it, and the big and little stabilizing caps...
2010-11-22 03:57:10	Rezagrats	The 33p thing?
2010-11-22 03:57:19	Rezagrats	There's a C1 and a C2 of them ?
2010-11-22 03:57:30	dfj	yup.
2010-11-22 03:57:46	dfj	33 picofarad caps - they help the crystal a lot.
2010-11-22 03:58:50	Rezagrats	What's the receptical for the main chip called?
2010-11-22 03:58:51	dfj	but - depending on what you have for cables and jacks - just use whatever if you have something that works - them bits are just to get the signals to the keyboard and computer, respectively.
2010-11-22 04:00:12	dfj	you might have a female 5 pin DIN from an old motherboard, but you might not - in which case you could look at how the XT's cable connects on the inside, and you are much more likely to have that connector on something.
2010-11-22 04:00:42	Rezagrats	I have an MMX board.
2010-11-22 04:01:14	 *	Rezagrats wanted the expansions cards more than anything else when he bought the computer for less than 5$
2010-11-22 04:01:15	dfj	If you were building a computer you'd be all mellow about how to fix a hard-drive in place so it was stable and looked good - but you'd also use what you had, if you lucked out....
2010-11-22 04:02:16	dfj	look at the picture again - it has way less parts than a PC.
2010-11-22 04:02:28	Rezagrats	...right...
2010-11-22 04:02:35	Rezagrats	What's your point ?
2010-11-22 04:02:51	dfj	my point is you'll be fine.
2010-11-22 04:03:22	Rezagrats	You never did answer my question about the receptical for the main chip.
2010-11-22 04:03:38	dfj	oh - 'chip holder' sorry.
2010-11-22 04:03:52	dfj	'socket' if you prefer.
2010-11-22 04:04:06	dfj	you'll have scads of them on old ISA cards and the like.
2010-11-22 04:04:47	dfj	longer is ok, wider requires breaking it in half and nipping out the middle.
2010-11-22 04:05:40	dfj	the goal is to solder the thing in rather than the bare chip so that 1) you can easily replace the chip if you wreck it, and 2) you are less likely to cook it while soldering.
2010-11-22 04:06:05	Rezagrats	Ha
2010-11-22 04:06:15	dfj	you could also build this into a $4-$5 solderless breadboard if you find one locally...
2010-11-22 04:06:22	Rezagrats	One of the GPUs you sent me has like 8 of them on it,
2010-11-22 04:06:46	dfj	yup - RAM sockets.
2010-11-22 04:06:58	Rezagrats	I'm not sure if i can get the solder off though.
2010-11-22 04:07:04	acfrazier	Radioshack sells solderless breadboards
2010-11-22 04:07:10	Rezagrats	They used very small amount of solder.
2010-11-22 04:07:13	dfj	btw - desoldering them will be important to get used to soldering, if you go that route.
2010-11-22 04:07:51	dfj	but - you can also torch the back while popping them off, if you are nimble.
2010-11-22 04:08:22	dfj	someone here reccomends shielding with tinfolk so you don't roast other chips, etc...
2010-11-22 04:08:31	dfj	aluminum foil.
2010-11-22 04:09:01	Rezagrats	Haha
2010-11-22 04:09:05	acfrazier	Tinfoil works for reflow, too
2010-11-22 04:09:07	Rezagrats	"tinfolk"
2010-11-22 04:09:17	dfj	then use a heat-gun or torch to get them wet.
2010-11-22 04:09:18	acfrazier	I can personally attest to that
2010-11-22 04:09:36	Rezagrats	Well, if i owned a hair dryer, it would work.
2010-11-22 04:09:42	Rezagrats	But i hate them things.
2010-11-22 04:09:45	dfj	ah, right - we were both on when the bloke suggested...
2010-11-22 04:09:53	Rezagrats	1800W is more than anything i've ever used.
2010-11-22 04:10:00	dfj	not certain a hair dryer is not enough... will it take paint off?
2010-11-22 04:10:10	dfj	hot enough.

2010-11-22 04:10:29	Rezagrats	I'm sure a n 1800W hair dryer will peel paint off a car.
2010-11-22 04:10:32	dfj	hair dryers are high-flow, a heat gun can blow less ahrd, with hotter air.
2010-11-22 04:10:48	dfj	ah - well, if you are _certain_, then I have my answer. :)
2010-11-22 04:11:08	Rezagrats	I know my mom has this 'crafting heat blower'
2010-11-22 04:11:22	Rezagrats	Worked well when i need to dry glue in less than 10min.
2010-11-22 04:11:40	Rezagrats	It also boiled the glue.
2010-11-22 04:11:59	dfj	right... so, my hair dryer is 1800W, but it doesn't set me on fire... (not that I have hair on my head anymore)...
2010-11-22 04:12:17	 *	Rezagrats makes a weird 'wtf' face.
2010-11-22 04:12:26	Rezagrats	Why would you have a hair dryer?
2010-11-22 04:12:41	dfj	but, my hot air gun is only a few hundred watts, but it goes to 700 degrees - it can melt aluminum.

2010-11-22 04:14:17	dfj	and if you want to feel superior, then: I did, in fact, have a mullet in the 80s. :P
2010-11-22 04:14:41	Rezagrats	That makes me sad.
2010-11-22 04:14:50	dfj	not as sad as me.
2010-11-22 04:15:42	Rezagrats	Anyhow
2010-11-22 04:15:47	dfj	heh.
2010-11-22 04:15:53	Rezagrats	I need to go exercise or something
2010-11-22 04:16:02	dfj	<rofl>
2010-11-22 04:16:13	Rezagrats	I fapped earlier today and slept for 2-3 hours
2010-11-22 04:16:21	 *	Rezagrats will need a reason to sleep tonight.
