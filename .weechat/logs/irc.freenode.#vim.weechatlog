2010-08-19 15:29:26	ednos	there is a very live vim vs emacs war where I work
2010-08-19 15:29:40	daniel	heh, neat
2010-08-19 15:29:41	jamessan	ednos: that's because you defined the command as DiffOrrig not DiffOrig

2010-08-19 15:30:11	ednos	jamessan: that was a typo because I can't copy/paste; I checked that typo in vim
2010-08-19 15:31:29	jamessan	ednos: then I'd check ":command" to see if you actually defined it
2010-08-19 15:31:36	ednos	k
2010-08-19 15:32:10	ednos	interesting--not defined
2010-08-19 15:32:56	jamessan	so the file that you put it in isn't being sourced
2010-08-19 15:33:09	jamessan	:scriptnames   will show you which files are being sourced
2010-08-19 15:34:09	ednos	it's .vimrc, and it's most certainly being sourced, because all my maps are there, as well as my cindent options

2010-08-19 18:00:17	TidusBlade	I'm trying to set my gvim to take up all possible space through "set lines=999 columns=999" but the window always opens up at the default size. "set winwidth=999 winheight=999" also didn't do anything... I know I placed it correctly and wrapped it with "if has("gui")" and the other commands work so my only idea is that something else is resetting the values but maybe I'm doing something wrong?

If you don't have a corresponding /ftdetect/opengl.vim then you're responsible for loading it in your ~/.vimrc with an autocmd. There is http://github.com/dahu/zzzomg but for this case, you might need an extra symlink because I doubt your files are named foo.opengl, but rather foo.gl (i may be wrong -
2010-08-20 02:44:20	bairui	never used gl)

2010-08-20 03:30:26	bairui	Tabs are poorly named in Vim. They should have been called viewports.
2010-08-20 03:30:26	falconindy	like :bn :bp?
2010-08-20 03:30:30	bairui	no
2010-08-20 03:30:43	bairui	like :b # or :b partial and <Tab> out from there
2010-08-20 03:30:51	falconindy	aha
2010-08-20 03:30:57	bairui	I never use :bn and :bp - that's a slow way to edit
2010-08-20 03:31:05	falconindy	very slow
2010-08-20 03:31:11	falconindy	didn't realise :b had tab completion
2010-08-20 03:31:23	bairui	yep, but with :ls and :b, it's much quicker - yeah, <Tab> makes it *sweet*

2010-08-20 04:30:07	bairui	so, he had to lose a few brain cells in Lispland... fair enough... :)
2010-08-20 04:30:18	tcha-tcho	haha ... bairui i will to look into dojo more carefully now, i hope to fix the code tonight :)
2010-08-20 04:30:43	bairui	cool - I was just about to ask if you had made any progress on it crashing in the terminal?
2010-08-20 04:31:12	Raimondi	tcha-tcho: I tried dojo on the termianl and  it doesn't crash, it just puts vim to sleep on the background

2010-08-20 04:31:34	Raimondi	I had to wake it up three times for it to start working
2010-08-20 04:31:45	bairui	Raimondi, tcha-tcho: terminal sleep = crash (in my book) :)
2010-08-20 04:32:12	bairui	ah... I didn't attempt the resuscitation that many times...

2010-08-20 05:23:25	rking	I don't usually use gvim, and I just noticed that when you have some text highlighted (and thus the X selection), then you go to another window and select something else, the gvim text changes style to let you know it's now the vim selection but not the X selection. Which is a great design touch. Yay gvim.
2010-08-20 05:24:03	bairui	it's okay to love your vim... :)
2010-08-20 05:24:54	rking	Well I do already---that's a long-standing relationship, like an old couple that never has to speak to each other. This gvim thing is still a burgeoning relationship.

2010-08-20 06:22:32	bairui	tcha-tcho: I just tested dojo... here are some thoughts... 1. give some feedback to the user about how many steps (buffers) remain in the current kata. I found it confusing that after the first kjkji that it went to a new buffer with no instructions - do I just continue doing kjkji on each buffer? So, maybe add a status line at the top of every buffer (or somewhere) to reassure young practitioners :)
2010-08-20 06:23:55	tcha-tcho	bairui: Great! i will do that now
2010-08-20 06:25:05	tcha-tcho	bairui: did you see a litle progress bar in the top of the window... do you think i must do that more clear?

2010-08-20 06:29:55	bairui	ok, tcha-tcho, I see now that I was missing your status line because of the split window. So, yeah, use :only. As for window cleanup, there are things we can do to make that nicer for the user.

2010-08-20 07:25:50	bairui	Vin73: now, that's interesting... it seems that cscope has hijacked your :tag command...
2010-08-20 07:26:03	Vin73	bairui: can I remove cscope altogether?
2010-08-20 07:26:30	bairui	if you want to use cscope then you'll need to dig into its help to find out how to make it play nice, otherwise, sure, go ahead and torch cscope altogether
2010-08-20 07:26:50	Vin73	bairui: because I used to use ctags pretty much the same way and it used to work without any issues
2010-08-20 07:27:14	Vin73	bairui: I presume removing cscope will not affect anything else...

2010-08-20 07:34:12	thewoolleyman	:bairui thanks.
2010-08-20 07:34:36	bairui	well, it implies that the tag didn't make it into your tags file, or Vim isn't finding your tags file, or the tags file wasn't... generated right.

2010-08-20 07:38:10	bairui	well... the -R part looks good, but my (perhaps poor) reading of   man ctags   doesn't match your -h usage...

2010-08-20 11:24:24	bairui	well, cook is generic in English - method agnostic :)

2010-08-20 11:25:44	the_isz	bairui: kochen (= cooking) is generic, too, but at the same time means boiling, so we tend to use the special word (boiling, frying, baking) as often as possible.
2010-08-20 11:26:36	bairui	hmmm... would one bake a pizza? Roast it? Fire it? I dunno. Apart from fire, I can't think of a better term than cook...

2010-08-20 11:28:09	ciaranm	it's not roasting because it's assisted by liquid in the pizza dough
2010-08-20 11:28:09	bairui	ciaranm: ok... well, that sounds reasonable. :)
2010-08-20 11:28:21	the_isz	just call it space-pizza, which will make up for the lousy taste :P
2010-08-20 11:28:24	bairui	there's no liquid in meat?!

2010-08-20 11:28:46	ciaranm	bairui: there is, but the liquid in the meat isn't what does the cooking
2010-08-20 11:29:01	ciaranm	roasting and baking are the same thing except in baking most of the cooking work's done by liquid you stuck in there for that purpose
2010-08-20 11:29:35	ciaranm	now, bear in mind that the people who came up with that distinction are the same ones who think you sear the outside of meat to "keep the juices in"
2010-08-20 11:29:51	ciaranm	so, uh, it's pretty much bollocks. but that's what the definition is.

2010-08-20 11:40:32	the_isz	marlun: if another program does a write on the same file you'll get asked whether vim should reload the file. don't know if it's possible automate, though...
2010-08-20 11:40:57	bairui	actually, truth be told, I haven't even looked at emacs since second year uni (and that's some years back now). However, I don't subscribe to the theory that emacs is any less an editor than Vim. The two reign supreme above all the other crap out there. 'Nuff said. :)

2010-08-20 14:13:54	r4tune	semantics
2010-08-20 14:14:01	jamessan	it's a big difference
2010-08-20 14:14:04	r4tune	how
2010-08-20 14:14:12	r4tune	it stole my ctrl by not passing it on
2010-08-20 14:15:15	jamessan	it is passing it on. it's just that there's no difference between # and <C-#> the way terminals currently communicate that to the underlying applications
2010-08-20 14:15:28	jamessan	it'd be different if the terminal did communicate a difference but the application didn't handle it
2010-08-20 14:16:03	r4tune	i see
2010-08-20 14:16:04	jamessan	you can put xterm into a mode where it is actually able to signify a difference between the two, but then you're stuck with essentially no applications understanding modified keys

2010-08-20 19:53:29	bamccaig	The lines don't all match a pattern though. :\
2010-08-20 19:54:38	Raimondi	you can use a for loop:   :for l in [1,3,6,9,14,999] | delete | endfor
2010-08-20 19:54:40	bamccaig	I'm basically trying to figure out how to easily resolve conflict markers in a file. :) In particular, when two unrelated functions have been mashed together. I'd like to basically delete the lines from one and put them below.
2010-08-20 19:55:15	tremby	kinda sounds like a job for sed rather than vim
2010-08-20 19:55:44	Raimondi	that for example is wrong, I forgot the range.

2010-08-20 21:45:27	yko	jsut for example, http://gist.github.com/540990 i want to be able select all between <div> ... </div> and just shift everything right, keeping % line at first column

2010-08-20 21:46:26	DHulme	you could make your own command that checks each line for the first character being % and only shifts if it isn't.
2010-08-20 21:47:22	yko	well, yes i could... but i hope to keep all defaults and achieve this behaivior with minimal changes...

It has been replaced with 'cindent', and setting 'cindent' also overrides 'smartindent'. Vim has indentation support for many languages out-of-the-box, and setting 'smartindent' (or 'cindent', for that matter) in your .vimrc might interfere with this. Use 'filetype indent on' and be happy.

2010-08-21 00:42:04	__debaser	so if I dont have a mapping that uses the local leader, it will do nothing?
2010-08-21 00:42:19	spiiph	I think you covered it. There should be a filetype plugin loaded, that defines the mappings.
2010-08-21 00:43:23	Raimondi	__debaser: I'm trying to see where the mappings is created...
2010-08-21 00:43:24	bairui	__debaser: was line 7 the only one in :scriptnames that mentioned clojure?
2010-08-21 00:44:14	__debaser	yes it was
2010-08-21 00:45:04	Raimondi	__debaser: ftplugin/clojure.vim is the one that seems responsible for setting the mappings. I don't know why it's not being sourced when the filetype is set. ideas anynone?
2010-08-21 00:46:12	Raimondi	__debaser: Did you install the files by hand?
2010-08-21 00:46:16	bairui	have we asked for    :set ft?    and   :filetype   yet?
2010-08-21 00:46:38	Raimondi	mmm... I think not :/
2010-08-21 00:47:10	Raimondi	I thought I had...
2010-08-21 00:47:18	__debaser	yes, I installed the files by hand
2010-08-21 00:47:24	Raimondi	Indeed I did, but didn't wait for a an answer :(
2010-08-21 00:47:42	bairui	ah... my quick scan didn't find that...
2010-08-21 00:48:02	Raimondi	__debaser: What's the output of :set filetype?
2010-08-21 00:48:22	__debaser	filetype=
2010-08-21 00:48:29	bairui	hmm :)
2010-08-21 00:48:31	__debaser	in an empty buffer
2010-08-21 00:48:36	Raimondi	Oh!
2010-08-21 00:48:38	Raimondi	:)
2010-08-21 00:48:48	bairui	so, __debaser, you have to be in a clojure file to use clojure mappings...
2010-08-21 00:48:59	__debaser	filetype=clojure in a clj file
2010-08-21 00:49:14	bairui	good - and the clj maps still don't work there?
2010-08-21 00:49:38	__debaser	no
2010-08-21 00:49:40	bairui	so, what does   :filetype   say? (yes, that's different to   :set filetype?)

2010-08-21 05:41:25	meonkeys	I'm trying to implement functionality in Vim to assist with identifying per-word/intra-line differences in a unified diff file. Here's a mockup: http://imagebin.ca/view/LmlbQoR.html and more ideas: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.editors.vim/90975
2010-08-21 05:41:59	meonkeys	something I'm logically stuck on is how to highlight somewhat arbitrary bits of text.

2010-08-21 05:42:26	meonkeys	hmm, also, I'm not really sure how to identify which parts of diff lines are different, too.
2010-08-21 05:42:46	meonkeys	anyway, please let me know if you have any ideas. :)
2010-08-21 05:43:01	bairui	meonkeys: probably totally useless to your cause, but the linux tool wdiff does that...

2010-08-21 05:46:16	meonkeys	cool, yeah, I've used wdiff
2010-08-21 05:47:28	meonkeys	but wdiff requires the original files used to make the diff
2010-08-21 05:47:42	meonkeys	anyway, I might be able to get some ideas from wdiff, I suppose
2010-08-21 05:48:33	bairui	from memory you can customise its output... I wonder if you can bash it into something Vim could use... hmm...
2010-08-21 05:49:52	meonkeys	so, one thing that might work is if I could make Vim highlight specific areas of a file, like: characters 28-34 of line 15 and chars 28-30 of line 16

2010-08-21 05:51:34	bairui	yeah, but you can use column addresses in patterns
2010-08-21 05:52:01	meonkeys	hmm, true

2010-08-21 05:58:16	bairui	of course, you can use += too
2010-08-21 05:58:16	binjimon	awesome, let me try that :)
2010-08-21 05:58:50	bairui	sorry, that should have been   .=   not   +=
2010-08-21 06:01:03	binjimon	obviously not an advanced user here :)... do you mean you can add new PATH entries say by useing .="
2010-08-21 06:01:53	bairui	binjimon: yep -    :let $PATH .= ':/new/path/here'
2010-08-21 06:02:14	binjimon	cool, thanks bairui!
2010-08-21 06:04:06	bairui	um, but that's just the environment variable... if you mean Vim's    path   then you need to adjust that with set  -  :set path+=/new/path      :help 'path'   if you're unsure

2010-08-21 09:39:31	ku0n	if you line is longer than 80, you are doing something wrong

2010-08-21 09:44:27	ku0n	it can be reusable, but it's meant to shorten templates, not to be an ultra generic thing
2010-08-21 09:45:03	ku0n	so it's fine to have play_balll_link_to   play_soccer_link_to ... each which are used only once in the template
2010-08-21 09:45:16	JeanM	I see, thanks, but still if I placed it into a helper (I haven't read up on them yet), wouldn't that simply mean I placed this large line in a helper (function?) and call that from the view? I'd still have a too wide line inside the helper file, wouldn't I?
2010-08-21 09:45:17	ku0n	that the rails philosophy
2010-08-21 09:45:39	ku0n	JeanM: in the helper file you can break lines
2010-08-21 09:46:01	JeanM	right, the helper isnt haml
2010-08-21 09:46:15	ku0n	usually, you will align the dictionary keys on the :
2010-08-21 09:46:21	ku0n	:confirm -> ...
2010-08-21 09:46:24	ku0n	:method -> ...
2010-08-21 09:47:50	JeanM	I've been doing that during my "erb time", I've now switched to haml and came across the issue of not being able to break lines properly
