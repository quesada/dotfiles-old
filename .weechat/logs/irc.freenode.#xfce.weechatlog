2010-10-16 10:15:24	quesada1	I'm using xfce4-power-manager with xmonad (no DE). But it doesn't recognize the brightness buttons on my laptop. Should it? KDE does. Any idea what to try?

2010-10-16 10:17:55	ssuominen	xfce4-power-manager comes with the brightness panel plug-in for xfce4-panel
2010-10-16 10:18:21	ssuominen	no idea if there's supposed to be anything in the power manager itself...
2010-10-16 10:18:37	ssuominen	might be out of luck there
2010-10-16 10:21:03	quesada1	ssuominen: thanks, I can identify the keycodes for fn + F9 (brightness up) etc, but no idea where to place them, if there's a config file 
2010-10-16 10:21:39	quesada1	can this plugin be run outside of xfce-panel?
2010-10-16 10:25:09	ssuominen	no
2010-10-16 10:26:19	ssuominen	you get it by --enable-panel-plugins and it needs xfce4-panel headers to build, and runs only inside xfce4-panel
2010-10-16 10:27:03	quesada1	I tried it
2010-10-16 10:27:12	quesada1	it doesn't do anything when I click on it

2010-10-16 15:37:40	+jeromeg	or what ssuominen said, I don't know
2010-10-16 15:38:01	ssuominen	I have that command patched into the /etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc file used by startxfce4
2010-10-16 15:38:21	ssuominen	http://paste.pocoo.org/show/276181/
2010-10-16 15:38:23	ssuominen	Find line 200
2010-10-16 15:39:04	dli	ssuominen, do you mean I can simply startxfce4 then? with the patch
2010-10-16 15:39:12	Tucos	yay, 't works now, thanks ssuominen and jeromeg :)
2010-10-16 15:39:13	ssuominen	or, this http://paste.pocoo.org/show/276185/
2010-10-16 15:39:34	+jeromeg	Tucos: you are welcome ;)
2010-10-16 15:39:35	ssuominen	fix the xinitrc that comes with xfce-utils to look like that.
2010-10-16 15:39:56	ssuominen	then plain 'exec startxfce4' in .xinitrc and startx to run it works.
2010-10-16 15:40:47	ssuominen	http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6690
2010-10-16 15:40:52	dli	ssuominen, I disabled consolekit support in xfce and running "exec startxfce4" now, looks like I can safely enable support for consolekit then
2010-10-16 15:40:53	ssuominen	still unapplied to git... unfortunately
2010-10-16 15:41:15	dli	ssuominen, do you get a patch there?
2010-10-16 15:41:20	ssuominen	yep
2010-10-16 15:41:36	dli	ssuominen, then, I can apply the patch locally
2010-10-16 15:41:38	+jeromeg	ssuominen: because it's an ugly hack?
2010-10-16 15:42:06	ssuominen	jeromeg: only according to Debian folks which run their own non-upstreamized system for xinit
2010-10-16 15:42:36	+jeromeg	Jannis is not a debian folk afaik
2010-10-16 15:43:51	ssuominen	so far it's the only patch that works for git (assuming you don't have the non-standard xinit and consolekit launch scripts from debian)
2010-10-16 15:44:35	ssuominen	take dbus-launch off -> it breaks, take ck-launch-session off -> nothing else will start it
2010-10-16 15:45:31	dli	ssuominen, is it possible to replace the "Need authorization" message with something more indicative also?
2010-10-16 15:45:57	ssuominen	I don't get that message, got polkit-gnome installed so it prompts me with a password dialog instead.
2010-10-16 15:46:03	dli	ssuominen, very difficult to struggle with sudoers, policykit, or consolekit
2010-10-16 15:47:05	ssuominen	http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5450
2010-10-16 15:48:12	ssuominen	without gnome-polkit, you need to manually edit polkit rules by hand to get it working... but it's not much, since you get gvfs and gnome-keyring as Thunar deps now too.
2010-10-16 15:48:21	ssuominen	so the deps are already installed...
2010-10-16 15:50:11	+jeromeg	gvfs and gnome-keyring are not thunar deps
2010-10-16 15:50:36	ssuominen	gvfs is runtime dep for Thunar
2010-10-16 15:50:52	ssuominen	and gvfs needs to be built with gnome-disk-utility
2010-10-16 15:51:10	ssuominen	with those you get gnome-keyring, gnome-common, gnome-doc-utils, gconf-2, etc.
2010-10-16 15:51:30	+jeromeg	gvfs is an optionnal runtime dep
2010-10-16 15:51:40	+jeromeg	if it's there, thunar will use it
2010-10-16 15:51:55	+jeromeg	but if it's not here, thunar will work, but only for local filesystems
2010-10-16 15:51:59	ssuominen	true
2010-10-16 15:52:10	+jeromeg	so?
2010-10-16 15:55:44	ssuominen	so the point being, you still need to have polkit-gnome installed for authentication daemon (to get password dialog). or end up with messages of "not authorized" with OK sign. call that another optional runtime dep, for which you have deps already installed -- if Thunar is setup in a way non-local file systems works too.
2010-10-16 15:56:43	ssuominen	even need to patch it to refer from standard upstream version by changing OnlyShowIn=GNOME; in /etc/xdg/autostart/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1.desktop to NotShowIn=KDE; or a like
2010-10-16 15:56:58	ssuominen	or alternatively edit polkit rules by hand to avoid the dialog.
