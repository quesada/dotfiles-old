2010-08-15 17:28:06	Zaba	ghc uses it for assembling, it seems
2010-08-15 17:28:10	Zaba	hence it's trying to exec 'as'

2010-08-15 17:29:46	nicoo	ManDay: however, the overlay seems to be rathe buggy, because it introduces things like =python-2.4.whatever and =python-2.5.xyz)

2010-08-19 15:54:00	SuperFlo	apparently, they aren't exported in the file, it's only FOO=bar, so they must be sourced, then why sudo -s doesn't source them either.
2010-08-19 15:54:15	kevinfish	SuperFlo: oh, gud tip
2010-08-19 15:54:37	SuperFlo	good, idk, I guess if variables aren't preserved, it's for security reasons on shared boxes.
2010-08-19 15:54:46	SuperFlo	but I'd really like to understand the env.d thing.

2010-08-19 15:55:30	kevinfish	SuperFlo: seems like I recall login doing something like that rather than sudo (but it can be dangerous if I recall)

2010-08-19 19:48:02	mattmatteh	DMMatt: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Intel_GMA  you need to use intel drm framebuffer, which is required by xorg.  that will give you a nice console but no splash, you can try splash after, which should be just adding the image.  i have framebuffer but no pretty image, i dont like that :P

2010-08-20 01:34:20	GenTimTheToolMan	I have a question about using gentoo as a virtual guest.  Something I always thought would be cool are gentoo virtual appliances so that people can get started with gentoo without the install.  Well, I've seen a few people try this and ultimately went unmaintained.  However, that got me thinking, does virtual gentoo even make sense? Does the user gain anything from build a system optimized for a virtual environment?  If so, its a shame that no

Of course, there has to be a virtual linux on there, and I'm leaning towards gentoo.  However, it seems like it's more effort than it's worth.  Or maybe not.  I guess I'm waiting for someone to tell me to use Gentoo instead of Ubunutu.

2010-08-20 07:11:09	DMMatt	So I am apparently good enough to get Gentoo installed, Xorg installed and configured with nvidia drivers, but apparently am not good enough to get a USB mouse working in X. No problem using the mouse in the console via GPM, but X wants nothing to do with it. Anyone have any pointers?
2010-08-20 07:11:10	eN_Joy	how do i tell my ethernet link speed? mii-tool shows: eth0: negotiated 1000baseT-HD flow-control, link ok, howver ethtool eth0 shows: Speed: 100Mb/s
2010-08-20 07:11:16	DMMatt	I used genkernal all
2010-08-20 07:12:13	DMMatt	en_joym: good question as well, I was wondering the same.
2010-08-20 07:12:26	DMMatt	I'm used to FreeBSD where ifconfig tells you
2010-08-20 07:13:03	wulfen	dmmatt, if it's Xorg 1.8, you need to follow the 1.8 migration guide, or add option "allowemptyinput" "no" to your server flags in xorg.conf (the cheap and easy but inappropriate fix)
2010-08-20 07:13:27	n17ikh	DMMatt: Also make sure you're using the correct mouse device.. /dev/input/mice, maybe
2010-08-20 07:14:40	DMMatt	if I cat /dev/input/mice and move the mouse, I get junk, and thats what xorg.conf points to
2010-08-20 07:14:46	wulfen	I'm assuming your keyboard also doesn't work in xorg?
2010-08-20 07:15:02	DMMatt	I'm using whatever version emerge xorg-x11 installs, current portage
2010-08-20 07:15:13	delirus	DMMatt:  maybe add evdev and mouse to the INPUT_DEVICES="" section in make.conf
2010-08-20 07:15:24	delirus	not sure, it might need evdev for a usb mouse
2010-08-20 07:15:28	DMMatt	Dunno if the keyboard works or not, I do an xinit and can't get the xterm window to focus ol
2010-08-20 07:15:53	delirus	add keyboard to that section too, for good measure (should be enabled by default)
2010-08-20 07:15:57	DMMatt	delirus, I think you may be right, but I'd have to recompile xorg then, right?
2010-08-20 07:16:03	delirus	after you edit that, re-emerge xorg-drivers
2010-08-20 07:16:04	wulfen	dmmatt, I'll guarantee it doesn't, and that Xorg.0.log says it's disabling the legacy drivers.
2010-08-20 07:16:06	floppym	Perhaps you could pastebin /ver/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-08-20 07:16:08	delirus	not all of xorg, I think

2010-08-20 11:49:43	[Enrico]	markolo25: wrong

2010-08-20 11:49:52	markolo25	32bit
2010-08-20 11:49:53	[Enrico]	markolo25: x86_64 is 64 bit, i686 is 32 bit

2010-08-20 11:51:11	[Enrico]	markolo25: it is for some task, like multimedia task. anyway usually nothing you can see with human eyes
2010-08-20 11:51:27	markolo25	ok but for server purposes it shouldn't matter right

2010-08-20 11:52:28	[Enrico]	markolo25: 64 bit extension advantage are mainly on computation, and of course on the maximum amount of ram you can run with
2010-08-20 11:52:39	markolo25	ok
2010-08-20 11:52:49	markolo25	compatablility probably is the only issue
2010-08-20 11:52:55	markolo25	thanks enrico
2010-08-20 11:53:01	markolo25	i'll stay in 32bit
2010-08-20 11:53:01	[Enrico]	markolo25: mostly a fixed issue
2010-08-20 11:53:06	markolo25	oh ok
2010-08-20 11:53:06	markolo25	cool
2010-08-20 11:53:30	markolo25	do you guys know of any cpanel alternatives
2010-08-20 11:53:33	markolo25	for gentoo
2010-08-20 11:53:40	[Enrico]	markolo25: but for a desktop 64 bit system you likely need a multilib one for some applications like flash, skype, wine
2010-08-20 11:54:10	markolo25	oh ok no i'm going headless on this one since i have no remote desktop, i'm just in ssh
2010-08-20 11:54:13	markolo25	thanks enrico
2010-08-20 11:54:15	[Enrico]	since those app are 32 bit only you need a multilib system (i.e. a 64 bit system able to run 32 bit apps)
2010-08-20 11:54:34	markolo25	oh ok

2010-08-20 20:44:56	quesada	I'd like to switch to jdk, but using eselect java-vm set user-vm sun-jdk-1.6 gives an error. What's the correct syntax?
2010-08-20 20:45:40	lestat	btw is there a better way than: "cd /usr/share/bash-completion; for i in *; do eselect bashcomp enable --global $i; done" to enable bash completion for all modules ?

2010-08-20 22:15:16	spoonb	TheLorax: There are several ways depending on what you want to do with it. The quick and dirty way is to simply compile something with gcc using the -native and look at the command arguements via top or something. But there are other more elegant solutions here.

2010-08-20 22:16:33	ppman_	I tried to, but nobody's smart there, and I think it's partially the sheevaplug's fault
2010-08-20 22:16:56	ppman_	when I had a similar setup on an openwrt router, everything clamped perfectly and all clients were happy,
2010-08-20 22:16:59	spoonb	TheLorax: But in your case you can be sure that adding native to replace k8 alone is a good/safe choice.

2010-08-21 00:11:11	spoonb	gruptka: CFLAGS and USE are different. One is compiler optimization and the 3dnow use flag enables a packages 3dnow specifc code. Not sure if this is worded well.

2010-08-21 04:10:48	lukasg	DMMatt, I had the setup you describe working for me (KDE though, not Gnome). This was the config I was using at that time: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/252625/

2010-08-21 04:11:47	spoonb	AfroTurf: fdisk doesn't get rid of the bootloader. Writting it over with grub will though.

2010-08-21 04:12:36	SteampunkDuck	Essentially that happens is that dhcpcd will hang up on the new kernel, I can still see my eth0, but it will refuse to go on to the internet with the new kernel
2010-08-21 04:12:47	spoonb	AfroTurf: No need to emerge. You need to grub-install /dev/sda again. Repace with you disk.
2010-08-21 04:13:06	spoonb	AfroTurf: And ensure you are booting from the disk you installed grub on.

2010-08-21 04:22:17	frenchy	jklehm, did it work
2010-08-21 04:22:36	jklehm	frenchy: sadly no :(
2010-08-21 04:22:41	spoonb	frenchy: Yes but oddly is only works like that for the partitions. The disk numbers still start at 0.
2010-08-21 04:23:25	jklehm	i suppose there is a symlink in there anyway that would route any /boot specified paths back to the right spot
2010-08-21 04:23:27	frenchy	spoonb, yeah i read an article about it in linux journal, i dont know why they changed it after all these years

2010-08-21 04:26:24	frenchy	jklehm, i dont know how grub-install works i always go into the grub CLI using the grub command and then do "root (hd0,0)" then setup (hd0)"
2010-08-21 04:27:02	lukasg	frenchy, setup(hd0) is pretty much equivalent to grub-install /dev/sda

2010-08-21 05:01:35	TheLorax	sounds like 2 problems. I recently had a problem mounting. Turns out, with the liveCD I got /dev/hdb, and with my kernel I got /dev/sda. If you can read the mounting error properly it should tell you available drives, if you have your controller driver compiled into the kernel properly
2010-08-21 05:02:13	TheLorax	if no drives are listed, could be a block device controller error

But actually the passphrase is correct. (In git it works.) Any ideas where the problem is? I'm using openssh 5.5_p1-r1. Thanks in advance.

2010-08-21 06:08:41	Kitsoran	Hi again again. On Slackware it disabled ACPI with a year limit of 2001. Gentoo year limit in the kernel conf seems to default to 2000. If I enabled ACPI on slackware it gave me crap ping time, point to point between two computers I think it went from ~0.15ish to a ms or few. Gentoo works fine with it on. Probably not important now, but any guesses on why that happened?

X, the handbook states that Xorg is by default configured to allow connections via the network. I'm trying to figure out exactly what that means. Does this mean that after typing startx, an arbitrary user on the network can access the Xsession?

2010-08-21 10:15:42	Nyth1	and yes, sometimes the monitor won't even acknowledge that the computer is on, which sounds like a vid card issue to me
2010-08-21 10:16:09	Nyth1	it's probably as simple as making sure everything is plugged in tightly and not loose, knowing my luck

2010-08-21 14:38:47	sirlark	Hi all, for some months now I've had a weird (consistent) glitch in firefox. The firefox google home page has some one pixel tears in the rendering. A couple of other sites have similar tears too. I've delved into the styling using firebug, and can fix things by tweaking the style setting s a bit. Anyone else had this, and is there a way to fix it?

I always wondered why there are no guidelines for it, rather than relying on/trusting the maintainer completely here.

2010-08-21 16:22:22	_spm_Draget	recently my pc has mutiple buffer underruns when playing hd-videos. C2D dualcore and fast harddisk and worked before, I am pretty sure it is not a hardware issue. The log says repeatedly 'audio output is starving'. mp4 demuxer... and I see 'aout_sdl' with filter scaletemo, and xvideo with scale swscale... could it be that I misconfigured somethign that makes VLC load unneded modukes?

2010-08-22 04:46:36	LameBMX	there should be like gnome-2.3 default and or failsafe
2010-08-22 04:46:39	BitOBear	gruptka: in theory, wireshark is installed with setuid or similar permissions elevation, by adding the user to the wireshark group, the wireshark program will be able to verify that the user _deserves_ to be able to manhandle interfaces. Note that if you are the user you just added to group wireshark, you need to log out an log back in again as /etc/group is only consulted during login. if done correctly, executing "ip -a" in your conso

2010-08-22 04:55:23	BitOBear	***T3hFly: I would recommend rebuilding your kernel with only ext4 and selecting the option to use ext4 divers for ext2 and ext3...
2010-08-22 04:55:57	T3hFly	BitOBear, was gonna still use ext2 for boot
2010-08-22 04:56:37	latenitess	BitOBear, ok so I ll just do that :)
2010-08-22 04:56:42	latenitess	thank you :)
2010-08-22 04:56:55	T3hFly	I mean I cant think of a good reason to use ext4 for a tiny little boot partition :)
2010-08-22 04:57:09	BitOBear	T3hFly: still would use ext2 for boot... this just tells the kernel to always use the ext4 driver for the other file systems. It has several wins over the ext2 and ext3 drivers even when writing those file systems. (like delayed allocation etc)

2010-08-22 04:58:00	T3hFly	BitOBear well I havnt even built the kernel yet. how do you propose i tell ext2 to use ext4 driver?
2010-08-22 04:58:12	BitOBear	T3hFly: I am not telling you to change the file systems to ext4, leave it ext2, just tell the _kernel_ to use the ext4 driver when opening ext2 and ext3 file systems.
2010-08-22 04:58:18	noirsoldats	Now, I remember at one point in time there was a package called noobjuice.. right?
2010-08-22 04:58:52	BitOBear	T3hFly: that is one of the options under EXT4 in the kernel config. you deselect EXT2 and EXT3 and then tell EXT4 it has the job.
2010-08-22 04:59:26	BitOBear	T3hFly... its a check-box...

2010-08-22 05:00:58	T3hFly	thx for the tip
2010-08-22 05:01:00	BitOBear	Its obvious when you get into the filesystems tab in the kernel config. 8-)
2010-08-22 05:02:02	T3hFly	I've been rolling kernels for a while and I hardly get a chance to play with ext4 because my normal dist of choice id Debian (im a server admin) this is my home pc
2010-08-22 05:02:15	dzee	i love how the installation guide made me use "links" to download the tarball. i havent seen the internet in black and white in over a decade. good times.
2010-08-22 05:02:19	BitOBear	Actually, even while building the /boot to begin with use mkfs to build the type of filesystem you want, but then mount it with "-t ext4", that will produce optimal file block placement and write speed during setup.

2010-08-22 05:03:54	BitOBear	Just _mount_ it with -t ext4, the file system flags will not change, but the files will not become as fragmented.

I kind of distrust the claim that I can upgrade from 4.3 to 4.4 without rebuilding every single package (maybe from lack of experience). also the docs says "To be completely safe that your system is in a sane state, you must rebuild the toolchain and then world to make use of the new compiler."..

2010-08-22 12:07:30	Wizzup	no, the build failure is due to libraries that are probably too new for the old wine
2010-08-22 12:07:39	danialus	i've got a problem with my keyboard layout inside X. I want it to be German and I set the XkbLayout option in my xorg.conf. The strange thing is: Under XFCE it works fine, but under Awesome WM it still keeps the american layout

2010-08-22 17:07:11	jshanab	cut-n-paste from pastebin and add in the proxy flag. It also looks like it will add in the APACHE2_MPMS prefork option. is that good or bad?
2010-08-22 17:07:29	delirus	danialus:  it's nice and lightweight like slim, but is more like gdm in functionality.  It's technically not a display manager, but works like one.

2010-08-22 17:15:32	jshanab	delirus. when you say it does nothing are you typing distcc on the command line? it will sit there forever waiting for you to type code I think. It is a dameon you run on each node after configing then you change the CC command in your makefiles or portage to use it.

When checking is easy and something is already set, can we avoid statements like "You need CONFIG_SYSVIPC enabled in your Kernel"   Check. IFF you cannot check  or the check fails THEN let people know.  It is trivial, i know, but it confuses users when you tell them they need to do something and it is already done.  I spent the...

2010-08-22 19:02:07	sedrik	lukasg: yeah, it was me being stupid =)
2010-08-22 19:02:07	jshanab	Ok, looks like I may of found a bug with gentoo's apache config scripts. I can get past it but I need someone to verify before I file a report. If you add the "-D PROXY" to the /etc/conf/apache2 and build apache with proxy use flag(extend use) the module is not loaded as seen with "apache2 -M" . If however you edit /etc/apache2/http.conf and remove gentoo's ifdefine guard around the...
2010-08-22 19:02:09	jshanab	...loadmodule for proxy, it works. It seems the word PROXY is not recognized.
2010-08-22 19:02:21	lukasg	sedrik, yes you should have :P (or done a eix-update)

2010-08-23 05:15:43	sfmasa	Noxz, that's all i can really say, is to try re-downloading, check md5sum, etc. sorry. i dont know what else could cause it from a cd

2010-08-23 05:16:09	Noxz	well, I do have a problem in windows, basiclaly if I dont have audio going, then I get a blue screen of IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL .. so I am trying to use linux to find the actual problem, since I changed alot of my hardware and I am still getting this problem, but I find it nice that gentoo will spit out an error at me immedietly
2010-08-23 05:16:16	Noxz	maybe it deals with what version it is?

2010-08-23 05:16:43	suser	Hi, I've just emerged k3b and when i launch the program it gives this error: "No optical device detected" from what i've read from searching this usually means HAL isn't installed, but that can't be the case because xorg is using it, is there anything i can try to get this corrected?
2010-08-23 05:16:47	Noxz	2.6.34 .. versus my 2.6.27.12

2010-08-23 05:21:17	suser	maybe this is all related, the css libraries aren't accessible when i try to play dvds with mplayer as 'user' but as root they are, and i have been having a lot of lock-ups when mounting, or accessing mounted media for the cdrom/dvd drive

2010-08-23 05:22:17	atl	can anyone help me out?
2010-08-23 05:22:28	atl	when i do emerge -Dup world to upgrade my kernel

2010-08-23 05:22:30	atl	well i rad the wiki
2010-08-23 05:22:44	atl	it's saying emerge -Dup world
2010-08-23 05:22:52	atl	that's what i'm trying to do
2010-08-23 05:23:02	ppman|lap	atl: the p means pretend
2010-08-23 05:23:20	suser	but world checks the whole system for upgrades, so it should also check the kernel
2010-08-23 05:23:52	atl	so what do i have to type now then
2010-08-23 05:24:24	suser	emerge -Duv world
2010-08-23 05:24:35	dark	atl, also, the kernel can't be upgraded by emerge (usually), you need to compile yourself, and move yourself to /boot
2010-08-23 05:24:48	ppman|lap	emerge -uDNav world is generally considered good update procdure
2010-08-23 05:24:53	suser	emerge -Duav world*
2010-08-23 05:24:59	dark	unless you use genkernel i think

2010-08-23 05:25:54	ppman|lap	that'll upgrade your kernel sources, which you then compile, as dark said
2010-08-23 05:27:12	 *	ppman|lap too low

2010-08-23 05:33:33	ppman|lap	ah
2010-08-23 05:35:04	denysonique	Noxz, why?
2010-08-23 05:35:15	Noxz	because I get a kernel panic with the most current one,
2010-08-23 05:38:12	ppman|lap	possibly - I'd also take a look at other livecd's like sysresccd
