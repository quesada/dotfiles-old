2010-08-15 17:28:06	Zaba	ghc uses it for assembling, it seems
2010-08-15 17:28:10	Zaba	hence it's trying to exec 'as'

2010-08-15 17:29:46	nicoo	ManDay: however, the overlay seems to be rathe buggy, because it introduces things like =python-2.4.whatever and =python-2.5.xyz)

2010-08-19 15:54:00	SuperFlo	apparently, they aren't exported in the file, it's only FOO=bar, so they must be sourced, then why sudo -s doesn't source them either.
2010-08-19 15:54:15	kevinfish	SuperFlo: oh, gud tip
2010-08-19 15:54:37	SuperFlo	good, idk, I guess if variables aren't preserved, it's for security reasons on shared boxes.
2010-08-19 15:54:46	SuperFlo	but I'd really like to understand the env.d thing.

2010-08-19 15:55:30	kevinfish	SuperFlo: seems like I recall login doing something like that rather than sudo (but it can be dangerous if I recall)

2010-08-19 19:48:02	mattmatteh	DMMatt: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Intel_GMA  you need to use intel drm framebuffer, which is required by xorg.  that will give you a nice console but no splash, you can try splash after, which should be just adding the image.  i have framebuffer but no pretty image, i dont like that :P

2010-08-20 01:34:20	GenTimTheToolMan	I have a question about using gentoo as a virtual guest.  Something I always thought would be cool are gentoo virtual appliances so that people can get started with gentoo without the install.  Well, I've seen a few people try this and ultimately went unmaintained.  However, that got me thinking, does virtual gentoo even make sense? Does the user gain anything from build a system optimized for a virtual environment?  If so, its a shame that no

Of course, there has to be a virtual linux on there, and I'm leaning towards gentoo.  However, it seems like it's more effort than it's worth.  Or maybe not.  I guess I'm waiting for someone to tell me to use Gentoo instead of Ubunutu.

2010-08-20 07:11:09	DMMatt	So I am apparently good enough to get Gentoo installed, Xorg installed and configured with nvidia drivers, but apparently am not good enough to get a USB mouse working in X. No problem using the mouse in the console via GPM, but X wants nothing to do with it. Anyone have any pointers?
2010-08-20 07:11:10	eN_Joy	how do i tell my ethernet link speed? mii-tool shows: eth0: negotiated 1000baseT-HD flow-control, link ok, howver ethtool eth0 shows: Speed: 100Mb/s
2010-08-20 07:11:16	DMMatt	I used genkernal all
2010-08-20 07:12:13	DMMatt	en_joym: good question as well, I was wondering the same.
2010-08-20 07:12:26	DMMatt	I'm used to FreeBSD where ifconfig tells you
2010-08-20 07:13:03	wulfen	dmmatt, if it's Xorg 1.8, you need to follow the 1.8 migration guide, or add option "allowemptyinput" "no" to your server flags in xorg.conf (the cheap and easy but inappropriate fix)
2010-08-20 07:13:27	n17ikh	DMMatt: Also make sure you're using the correct mouse device.. /dev/input/mice, maybe
2010-08-20 07:14:40	DMMatt	if I cat /dev/input/mice and move the mouse, I get junk, and thats what xorg.conf points to
2010-08-20 07:14:46	wulfen	I'm assuming your keyboard also doesn't work in xorg?
2010-08-20 07:15:02	DMMatt	I'm using whatever version emerge xorg-x11 installs, current portage
2010-08-20 07:15:13	delirus	DMMatt:  maybe add evdev and mouse to the INPUT_DEVICES="" section in make.conf
2010-08-20 07:15:24	delirus	not sure, it might need evdev for a usb mouse
2010-08-20 07:15:28	DMMatt	Dunno if the keyboard works or not, I do an xinit and can't get the xterm window to focus ol
2010-08-20 07:15:53	delirus	add keyboard to that section too, for good measure (should be enabled by default)
2010-08-20 07:15:57	DMMatt	delirus, I think you may be right, but I'd have to recompile xorg then, right?
2010-08-20 07:16:03	delirus	after you edit that, re-emerge xorg-drivers
2010-08-20 07:16:04	wulfen	dmmatt, I'll guarantee it doesn't, and that Xorg.0.log says it's disabling the legacy drivers.
2010-08-20 07:16:06	floppym	Perhaps you could pastebin /ver/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-08-20 07:16:08	delirus	not all of xorg, I think

2010-08-20 11:49:43	[Enrico]	markolo25: wrong

2010-08-20 11:49:52	markolo25	32bit
2010-08-20 11:49:53	[Enrico]	markolo25: x86_64 is 64 bit, i686 is 32 bit

2010-08-20 11:51:11	[Enrico]	markolo25: it is for some task, like multimedia task. anyway usually nothing you can see with human eyes
2010-08-20 11:51:27	markolo25	ok but for server purposes it shouldn't matter right

2010-08-20 11:52:28	[Enrico]	markolo25: 64 bit extension advantage are mainly on computation, and of course on the maximum amount of ram you can run with
2010-08-20 11:52:39	markolo25	ok
2010-08-20 11:52:49	markolo25	compatablility probably is the only issue
2010-08-20 11:52:55	markolo25	thanks enrico
2010-08-20 11:53:01	markolo25	i'll stay in 32bit
2010-08-20 11:53:01	[Enrico]	markolo25: mostly a fixed issue
2010-08-20 11:53:06	markolo25	oh ok
2010-08-20 11:53:06	markolo25	cool
2010-08-20 11:53:30	markolo25	do you guys know of any cpanel alternatives
2010-08-20 11:53:33	markolo25	for gentoo
2010-08-20 11:53:40	[Enrico]	markolo25: but for a desktop 64 bit system you likely need a multilib one for some applications like flash, skype, wine
2010-08-20 11:54:10	markolo25	oh ok no i'm going headless on this one since i have no remote desktop, i'm just in ssh
2010-08-20 11:54:13	markolo25	thanks enrico
2010-08-20 11:54:15	[Enrico]	since those app are 32 bit only you need a multilib system (i.e. a 64 bit system able to run 32 bit apps)
2010-08-20 11:54:34	markolo25	oh ok

2010-08-20 20:44:56	quesada	I'd like to switch to jdk, but using eselect java-vm set user-vm sun-jdk-1.6 gives an error. What's the correct syntax?
2010-08-20 20:45:40	lestat	btw is there a better way than: "cd /usr/share/bash-completion; for i in *; do eselect bashcomp enable --global $i; done" to enable bash completion for all modules ?

2010-08-20 22:15:16	spoonb	TheLorax: There are several ways depending on what you want to do with it. The quick and dirty way is to simply compile something with gcc using the -native and look at the command arguements via top or something. But there are other more elegant solutions here.

2010-08-20 22:16:33	ppman_	I tried to, but nobody's smart there, and I think it's partially the sheevaplug's fault
2010-08-20 22:16:56	ppman_	when I had a similar setup on an openwrt router, everything clamped perfectly and all clients were happy,
2010-08-20 22:16:59	spoonb	TheLorax: But in your case you can be sure that adding native to replace k8 alone is a good/safe choice.

2010-08-21 00:11:11	spoonb	gruptka: CFLAGS and USE are different. One is compiler optimization and the 3dnow use flag enables a packages 3dnow specifc code. Not sure if this is worded well.

2010-08-21 04:10:48	lukasg	DMMatt, I had the setup you describe working for me (KDE though, not Gnome). This was the config I was using at that time: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/252625/

2010-08-21 04:11:47	spoonb	AfroTurf: fdisk doesn't get rid of the bootloader. Writting it over with grub will though.

2010-08-21 04:12:36	SteampunkDuck	Essentially that happens is that dhcpcd will hang up on the new kernel, I can still see my eth0, but it will refuse to go on to the internet with the new kernel
2010-08-21 04:12:47	spoonb	AfroTurf: No need to emerge. You need to grub-install /dev/sda again. Repace with you disk.
2010-08-21 04:13:06	spoonb	AfroTurf: And ensure you are booting from the disk you installed grub on.

2010-08-21 04:22:17	frenchy	jklehm, did it work
2010-08-21 04:22:36	jklehm	frenchy: sadly no :(
2010-08-21 04:22:41	spoonb	frenchy: Yes but oddly is only works like that for the partitions. The disk numbers still start at 0.
2010-08-21 04:23:25	jklehm	i suppose there is a symlink in there anyway that would route any /boot specified paths back to the right spot
2010-08-21 04:23:27	frenchy	spoonb, yeah i read an article about it in linux journal, i dont know why they changed it after all these years

2010-08-21 04:26:24	frenchy	jklehm, i dont know how grub-install works i always go into the grub CLI using the grub command and then do "root (hd0,0)" then setup (hd0)"
2010-08-21 04:27:02	lukasg	frenchy, setup(hd0) is pretty much equivalent to grub-install /dev/sda

2010-08-21 05:01:35	TheLorax	sounds like 2 problems. I recently had a problem mounting. Turns out, with the liveCD I got /dev/hdb, and with my kernel I got /dev/sda. If you can read the mounting error properly it should tell you available drives, if you have your controller driver compiled into the kernel properly
2010-08-21 05:02:13	TheLorax	if no drives are listed, could be a block device controller error

But actually the passphrase is correct. (In git it works.) Any ideas where the problem is? I'm using openssh 5.5_p1-r1. Thanks in advance.

2010-08-21 06:08:41	Kitsoran	Hi again again. On Slackware it disabled ACPI with a year limit of 2001. Gentoo year limit in the kernel conf seems to default to 2000. If I enabled ACPI on slackware it gave me crap ping time, point to point between two computers I think it went from ~0.15ish to a ms or few. Gentoo works fine with it on. Probably not important now, but any guesses on why that happened?

X, the handbook states that Xorg is by default configured to allow connections via the network. I'm trying to figure out exactly what that means. Does this mean that after typing startx, an arbitrary user on the network can access the Xsession?

2010-08-21 10:15:42	Nyth1	and yes, sometimes the monitor won't even acknowledge that the computer is on, which sounds like a vid card issue to me
2010-08-21 10:16:09	Nyth1	it's probably as simple as making sure everything is plugged in tightly and not loose, knowing my luck

2010-08-21 12:02:45	gruptka	ah .. so I should emerge them at once to exclude the recursive merges. ok explained
2010-08-21 12:03:20	lukasg	gruptka, yep. "emerge -v takcd mplayer" and emerge will figure out the right order

2010-08-21 12:05:36	gruptka	ok, I will not break the emerge now, I fear a error in gcc or something.. but good to know that
2010-08-21 12:06:12	lukasg	gruptka, interrupting a merge with CTRL-C is safe (unless it happens to be in the merge phase)

2010-08-21 12:07:45	gruptka	I don't know in what part is.. bounch of code -DHAVE_CONFIG and stuff like that.. I will wait ;)
2010-08-21 12:08:26	lukasg	that's the compile phase, so it would be safe to cancel. But whatever floats your boat :)
