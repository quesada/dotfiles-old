2010-08-15 15:55:04	DHalens	hmm... anyway, a few commands accept the --nocolor param so unless it's a big issue, you can live with that
2010-08-15 15:55:31	mr4m	i'm trying to change the text color for a boot splash which uses a white background.
2010-08-15 15:56:35	mr4m	The specified text color is ignored ecause of the global colouring.

2010-08-18 16:20:09	kiuma	hello, I've installed gnome-light, but now in both kde and gnome the screen becomes white after few seconds they've been started, how can I solve this ?
2010-08-18 16:36:18	DHalens	you updated the kernel or graphic drivers too and compiz is somehow failing to start
2010-08-18 16:37:03	user_	but  does sabayon use half of it for its internal purspose? I see only 36 allocated for my suage.
2010-08-18 16:39:08	user_	i know for ext4 it reserves some disk space for its use, but half of the disk is a little too much in the asking
2010-08-18 16:39:09	DHalens	user_: i see 36 for / and 36 for /home (that is, if i understand the lvm thing...)
2010-08-18 16:40:00	user_	is that normal?
2010-08-18 16:41:08	user_	i thought the root wont require that much
2010-08-18 16:41:27	DHalens	well, the one who assigned the space was you...
2010-08-18 16:41:49	DHalens	or at least, the one who told the partitioner to autoasign the space was you
2010-08-18 16:41:49	user_	LOL...well...all I did was a next, next, next bro
2010-08-18 16:42:33	DHalens	heh, that's the reason some devs want to add a next button for search and delete all data in the computer
2010-08-18 16:42:45	user_	i used the automatic partioner and just left at that, did not look into it with details. I guess I should reinstall with manual partition
2010-08-18 16:43:02	DHalens	you can resize the partitions
2010-08-18 16:43:21	DHalens	but don't ask me, i have no idea of how to do that with lvm
2010-08-18 16:43:40	user_	u made me jump off the seat bro...even i am scared of that stuff
2010-08-18 16:44:06	user_	well...not scared...for its a fresh install ...at the max all i have to do a fresh install again.
2010-08-18 16:44:40	DHalens	up to you but if you reinstall, please at least read what the installer says...
2010-08-18 16:44:55	user_	you betcha...better I do
2010-08-18 16:45:10	DHalens	once installed you can ignore anything and as long as you're not root user, you won't break it

2010-08-19 16:50:46	Phazorx	very lame question - how do i make it so copy buffer is shared between xorg and consoles?
2010-08-19 16:51:29	Phazorx	basicaly being able to paste things into console (/dev/tty kind of console, not xterm) which have been copied under X?
2010-08-19 17:04:51	Enlik	maybe xclip will do, I'm not sure. If you use it on tty, it would be needed to set -display option I think (or DISPLAY variable).
2010-08-19 17:05:17	Enlik	I was told about this tool on this channel,too :)

2010-08-19 17:11:09	Phazorx	so buffers are always shared and no special tool needed to be launched at copy time to make it happen

2010-08-20 03:03:41	lythandrel	?? portage
2010-08-20 03:03:44	@|Cadmus|	portage[1]: is the source package manager for sabayon and other gentoo based distros.  http://wiki.sabayonlinux.org/index.php?title=En:HOWTO:_The_Complete_Portage_Guide
2010-08-20 03:03:48	@|Cadmus|	portage[2]: Please keep in mind, being familiar with portage involves quite a bit more than just typing "emerge package".
2010-08-20 03:04:02	lythandrel	read teh portage guide first, oyster.  then decide if that's something you want to do.
2010-08-20 03:04:36	lythandrel	oyster: keep in mind that gentoo isn't even bringing in kde 4.5 to portage yet... it is remaining in the overlay until it's a bit more stable and complete.
2010-08-20 03:06:06	oyster	lythandrel: I don't actually=) Just wanna get tiling in kwin.
2010-08-20 03:06:23	oyster	Maybe i really shouldn't do that:D

2010-08-20 03:14:57	Radtoo	Last thing I heard was that 64 bit flash was discontinued or temporarily suspended by adobe, and that you need to use a 32bit browser with the 32bit plugin (firefox-bin... for instance) to run flash
2010-08-20 03:15:07	Radtoo	Probably nothing has changed about that yet.
2010-08-20 03:15:59	Radtoo	Releases of 64 bit flash, I should say - I don't know what they develop.
2010-08-20 03:16:10	sabayonweb_11575	Radtoo: I tried to re-install nspluginwrapper but Oper still doesn't reproduce flash on YT
2010-08-20 03:16:41	Radtoo	Might want to use the html5 variant of youtube if nothing helps, or firefox-bin
2010-08-20 03:16:51	oyster	sabayonweb_11575: have you tried 'nspluginwrapper -a -v -i'?
2010-08-20 03:17:17	Radtoo	but I'm not an opera user, I don't know if it even should work or not. :D
2010-08-20 03:17:28	Radtoo	Just that probably a 64bit of opera may not work

2010-08-20 03:53:33	iRedWar	Greetings.
2010-08-20 03:53:58	dave_64	hi
2010-08-20 03:54:06	genfool	hello iRedWar
2010-08-20 03:54:13	iRedWar	hallo
2010-08-20 03:55:48	iRedWar	Workingon virtualizing. The kernel modules with virtualbox a little bit difficult to configure.  I wanted to know if anyone here has a preffered virtualizer?
2010-08-20 03:56:01	iRedWar	I ve got virt_manager getting set to run
2010-08-20 03:56:40	dave_64	huh?  i just installed vbox a few days ago and it worked out of the box
2010-08-20 03:58:23	iRedWar	I think if I got rid of the version i have of VBOX right now, prior to the updates, I mmight now have the problems I have had.  I am able to make it work, but I have to  keep loading kernal mods every boot
2010-08-20 03:58:36	iRedWar	But just asking if anyone has a preference for Sabayon
2010-08-20 03:59:06	dave_64	add the modules to a config file....let me check which one
2010-08-20 04:00:17	dave_64	add to /etc/conf.d/modules : modules="vboxdrv vboxnetadp vboxnetflt"
2010-08-20 04:01:15	iRedWar	yeah.. Im having to mess around with that. I got it from the forum, it works but have to do it every boot up
2010-08-20 04:02:00	iRedWar	But, I am looking to try others, just for the heck of it, I just did not know if there was in particular. I already loaded up virt_manager, and I m lworking on it as we speak
2010-08-20 04:02:07	dave_64	did you add that line at the end of the file, on a line by itself?  were you root?
2010-08-20 04:02:24	iRedWar	Yes I was root, and I added it on a line on its own
2010-08-20 04:02:55	iRedWar	So not sure what I am doing wrong there, I just saw someone else had the same problem, .. the line is there.. so not sure why i Have to keep loading it in terminal
2010-08-20 04:03:03	dave_64	maybe you need to add a carriage return after adding the line
2010-08-20 04:03:04	iRedWar	But its ok, I mean, it runs great when I do it
2010-08-20 04:03:22	iRedWar	That is a good idea, I did not think about that, is that how yours looks like>
2010-08-20 04:03:23	iRedWar	?

2010-08-20 04:05:37	dave_64	all i know is that there are some config files that need a carriage return after the last line.  in fact, i messed up my install (WINXP) and installed it as root, so i didnt get around to adding anything to modules
2010-08-20 04:06:24	dave_64	my keyboard has a stuck key ...the shift key is stuck down, so i have to type with caps lock on
2010-08-20 04:06:58	iRedWar	dave_64 I am trying to mess around with WINXP x86 sp 3, but I keep getting the error, ISO not bootable.  Looked up some forums,and ppl were having problems.  I dont know if  I was in root.  But the error actually is no bootable media is found
2010-08-20 04:07:08	iRedWar	I was able to ge tFedora12 to work though
2010-08-20 04:07:10	dave_64	humidity is off the chart around here this past two months
2010-08-20 04:07:19	iRedWar	Where are you at dave?
2010-08-20 04:07:28	iRedWar	Im in FLorida, its pretty hot out here
2010-08-20 04:07:35	iRedWar	Humid  uggh
2010-08-20 04:07:41	dave_64	iowa
2010-08-20 04:07:48	iRedWar	stay cool budy
2010-08-20 04:07:57	iRedWar	Its hot and sticky out here
2010-08-20 04:08:10	genfool	dave_64,  I find that if I do not spill beer on the kb, the keys do not stick.
2010-08-20 04:08:34	dave_64	iRedWar: type    modprobe vboxdrv      before trying to install
2010-08-20 04:08:36	iRedWar	I find if I spill keys on the keyboard, that my computer runs faster
2010-08-20 04:08:57	iRedWar	dave_64 right before the install
2010-08-20 04:08:58	iRedWar	?
2010-08-20 04:09:16	iRedWar	Spill beer
2010-08-20 04:09:20	iRedWar	I just saw that
2010-08-20 04:09:21	iRedWar	doh
2010-08-20 04:09:29	dave_64	anytime after linux is booted.....yeah,  beer...heh, heh
2010-08-20 04:12:58	dave_64	are you sure your cdrom is mounted?
2010-08-20 04:13:35	iRedWar	Yeah it is.  I am working on it now, but I actually want to save this install.. and really test out virt manager have you used it yet?
2010-08-20 04:13:54	dave_64	no
2010-08-20 04:14:00	iRedWar	that command you gave me btw is what I use  when I first work it
2010-08-20 04:14:14	iRedWar	But XP ISO, checksum is good, not sure what the deal is there
2010-08-20 04:14:32	iRedWar	I also have some ISO with seven 32 bit, but that failed too initially
2010-08-20 04:14:47	iRedWar	But that was before I did the additional lines.. So as we speak I m working on adding it
2010-08-20 04:15:20	iRedWar	But I think Im going to try to use Virt_manager with 2008 Server guest and Sabayon as HOst
2010-08-20 04:16:22	iRedWar	XP Ill throw int here
2010-08-20 04:16:54	iRedWar	I noticed no how to, if I get it to work the way Im hoping, I would like to add to the forums... so I just submit it right?
2010-08-20 04:17:09	iRedWar	(virt_manager how to)
2010-08-20 04:17:21	iRedWar	Very scant what is out there
2010-08-20 04:17:23	dave_64	i don't know much about virtualization.  I just played with it a few times,  and recently installed winxp to see if i could still do it
2010-08-20 04:18:04	genfool	you could add it to the wiki, under "how to"
2010-08-20 04:19:44	iRedWar	Awesome, Im taking notes right now, so I got it on my Tomboy, and as I get through it I ll keep doing it
2010-08-20 04:19:47	iRedWar	ththen post
2010-08-20 04:20:17	iRedWar	I think this would be very useful, especially for those that are looking for alternative hypervisors
2010-08-20 04:20:24	iRedWar	or virtualizers I mena
2010-08-20 04:20:25	dave_64	yeah, i see vbox is already in the wiki howto
2010-08-20 04:20:50	iRedWar	yeah, it was very helpful, its where i got also that vbox moddrv stuff
2010-08-20 04:20:51	iRedWar	also
2010-08-20 04:21:41	iRedWar	So that was very helpful. Just slightly buggy, just not sure why I am having the hard time with the XP ISO, but I did have screwed up repos before, and it appears, that I may actually need to update  VOBX anyways
2010-08-20 04:21:45	iRedWar	VBOX
2010-08-20 04:22:10	iRedWar	Meanwhile, last night I installed virt_manager, with QEMU and working the modules part as we speak
2010-08-20 04:22:37	dave_64	is the winxp in the form of an iso?  it should be an image
2010-08-20 04:25:05	iRedWar	ISO are not images?
2010-08-20 04:25:16	iRedWar	What am I misisng?
2010-08-20 04:25:50	dave_64	if the file is of the form, winxp.iso    it is not an image....it (the .iso file) needs to be burned as an image
2010-08-20 04:26:05	iRedWar	This was burned into my CD then I moved it
2010-08-20 04:26:19	iRedWar	I used ISO BURN
2010-08-20 04:26:22	iRedWar	But ok
2010-08-20 04:26:28	dave_64	is the cd bootable
2010-08-20 04:26:38	iRedWar	Its bootable on its own yes
2010-08-20 04:27:02	dave_64	when you boot with the cd in place,  does it come up with the winxp installer?
2010-08-20 04:27:08	iRedWar	yes
2010-08-20 04:27:24	dave_64	ok, then it's an image...it should work with vbox
2010-08-20 04:27:46	iRedWar	yup that is what is throwing me for the loop there.   But... we will see
2010-08-20 04:27:55	iRedWar	I m working on it now
2010-08-20 04:28:11	dave_64	how are you starting vbox?
2010-08-20 04:29:26	iRedWar	with the modprobe
2010-08-20 04:29:39	iRedWar	It works with the other ISO's when I do that
2010-08-20 04:29:47	iRedWar	including my server 2003
2010-08-20 04:30:29	dave_64	i mean, are you starting vbox from a terminal with the command: VirtualBox
2010-08-20 04:31:37	iRedWar	I was running it form terminal before
2010-08-20 04:31:42	iRedWar	from
2010-08-20 04:31:54	iRedWar	Let me run it, I was just editing
2010-08-20 04:31:58	iRedWar	with VIM
2010-08-20 04:32:28	dave_64	and did you type: modprobe vboxdrv        at a root terminal before running VirtualBox    (at a user terminal_

2010-08-20 04:48:11	iRedWar	To make it work I usually have to do this...   for m in vbox{drv,netadp,netflt}; do modprobe $m; done
2010-08-20 04:48:36	iRedWar	Now, here is the thing.... I noticed in the equo search...   I have a lot of not installs, at least listed
2010-08-20 04:48:55	iRedWar	How about if we remove all instances of virtualbox and do another install
2010-08-20 04:49:21	iRedWar	maybe this is just a matter of what I was experiencing with some kernal issues that I just recently resovled
2010-08-20 04:49:40	dave_64	iRedWar: just run: equo remove virtualbox      then run: equo install virtualbox-bin
2010-08-20 04:51:27	iRedWar	equo remove virtual box asked about whch one... so should i just remove each one?
2010-08-20 04:51:40	iRedWar	Or remove all other the virtualbox bin
2010-08-20 04:52:19	dave_64	man,  now i'm getting confused   :)     you're call
2010-08-20 04:54:09	dave_64	all i know is my "notes"  suggest installing virtualbox-bin    and then do the other things cadmus showed you
2010-08-20 04:54:12	dave_64	?? vbox
2010-08-20 04:54:13	@|Cadmus|	vbox[1]: To configure virtualbox, after installation do the following
2010-08-20 04:54:15	@|Cadmus|	vbox[2]: modprobe vboxdrv ; modprobe vboxnetadp ; modprobe vboxnetflt
2010-08-20 04:54:17	@|Cadmus|	vbox[3]: then add the following line to the end of /etc/conf.d/modules
2010-08-20 04:54:19	@|Cadmus|	vbox[4]: modules="vboxdrv vboxnetadp vboxnetflt"
2010-08-20 04:56:19	dave_64	the first 2 items are to run vbox without rebooting...the last two items are to allow you to run vbox without loading the modules after every reboot
2010-08-20 04:56:38	iRedWar	Ok.. Im going to do it
