2010-08-15 15:55:04	DHalens	hmm... anyway, a few commands accept the --nocolor param so unless it's a big issue, you can live with that
2010-08-15 15:55:31	mr4m	i'm trying to change the text color for a boot splash which uses a white background.
2010-08-15 15:56:35	mr4m	The specified text color is ignored ecause of the global colouring.

2010-08-18 16:20:09	kiuma	hello, I've installed gnome-light, but now in both kde and gnome the screen becomes white after few seconds they've been started, how can I solve this ?
2010-08-18 16:36:18	DHalens	you updated the kernel or graphic drivers too and compiz is somehow failing to start
2010-08-18 16:37:03	user_	but  does sabayon use half of it for its internal purspose? I see only 36 allocated for my suage.
2010-08-18 16:39:08	user_	i know for ext4 it reserves some disk space for its use, but half of the disk is a little too much in the asking
2010-08-18 16:39:09	DHalens	user_: i see 36 for / and 36 for /home (that is, if i understand the lvm thing...)
2010-08-18 16:40:00	user_	is that normal?
2010-08-18 16:41:08	user_	i thought the root wont require that much
2010-08-18 16:41:27	DHalens	well, the one who assigned the space was you...
2010-08-18 16:41:49	DHalens	or at least, the one who told the partitioner to autoasign the space was you
2010-08-18 16:41:49	user_	LOL...well...all I did was a next, next, next bro
2010-08-18 16:42:33	DHalens	heh, that's the reason some devs want to add a next button for search and delete all data in the computer
2010-08-18 16:42:45	user_	i used the automatic partioner and just left at that, did not look into it with details. I guess I should reinstall with manual partition
2010-08-18 16:43:02	DHalens	you can resize the partitions
2010-08-18 16:43:21	DHalens	but don't ask me, i have no idea of how to do that with lvm
2010-08-18 16:43:40	user_	u made me jump off the seat bro...even i am scared of that stuff
2010-08-18 16:44:06	user_	well...not scared...for its a fresh install ...at the max all i have to do a fresh install again.
2010-08-18 16:44:40	DHalens	up to you but if you reinstall, please at least read what the installer says...
2010-08-18 16:44:55	user_	you betcha...better I do
2010-08-18 16:45:10	DHalens	once installed you can ignore anything and as long as you're not root user, you won't break it

2010-08-19 16:50:46	Phazorx	very lame question - how do i make it so copy buffer is shared between xorg and consoles?
2010-08-19 16:51:29	Phazorx	basicaly being able to paste things into console (/dev/tty kind of console, not xterm) which have been copied under X?
2010-08-19 17:04:51	Enlik	maybe xclip will do, I'm not sure. If you use it on tty, it would be needed to set -display option I think (or DISPLAY variable).
2010-08-19 17:05:17	Enlik	I was told about this tool on this channel,too :)

2010-08-19 17:11:09	Phazorx	so buffers are always shared and no special tool needed to be launched at copy time to make it happen

2010-08-20 03:03:41	lythandrel	?? portage
2010-08-20 03:03:44	@|Cadmus|	portage[1]: is the source package manager for sabayon and other gentoo based distros.  http://wiki.sabayonlinux.org/index.php?title=En:HOWTO:_The_Complete_Portage_Guide
2010-08-20 03:03:48	@|Cadmus|	portage[2]: Please keep in mind, being familiar with portage involves quite a bit more than just typing "emerge package".
2010-08-20 03:04:02	lythandrel	read teh portage guide first, oyster.  then decide if that's something you want to do.
2010-08-20 03:04:36	lythandrel	oyster: keep in mind that gentoo isn't even bringing in kde 4.5 to portage yet... it is remaining in the overlay until it's a bit more stable and complete.
2010-08-20 03:06:06	oyster	lythandrel: I don't actually=) Just wanna get tiling in kwin.
2010-08-20 03:06:23	oyster	Maybe i really shouldn't do that:D

2010-08-20 03:14:57	Radtoo	Last thing I heard was that 64 bit flash was discontinued or temporarily suspended by adobe, and that you need to use a 32bit browser with the 32bit plugin (firefox-bin... for instance) to run flash
2010-08-20 03:15:07	Radtoo	Probably nothing has changed about that yet.
2010-08-20 03:15:59	Radtoo	Releases of 64 bit flash, I should say - I don't know what they develop.
2010-08-20 03:16:10	sabayonweb_11575	Radtoo: I tried to re-install nspluginwrapper but Oper still doesn't reproduce flash on YT
2010-08-20 03:16:41	Radtoo	Might want to use the html5 variant of youtube if nothing helps, or firefox-bin
2010-08-20 03:16:51	oyster	sabayonweb_11575: have you tried 'nspluginwrapper -a -v -i'?
2010-08-20 03:17:17	Radtoo	but I'm not an opera user, I don't know if it even should work or not. :D
2010-08-20 03:17:28	Radtoo	Just that probably a 64bit of opera may not work

2010-08-20 03:53:33	iRedWar	Greetings.
2010-08-20 03:53:58	dave_64	hi
2010-08-20 03:54:06	genfool	hello iRedWar
2010-08-20 03:54:13	iRedWar	hallo
2010-08-20 03:55:48	iRedWar	Workingon virtualizing. The kernel modules with virtualbox a little bit difficult to configure.  I wanted to know if anyone here has a preffered virtualizer?
2010-08-20 03:56:01	iRedWar	I ve got virt_manager getting set to run
2010-08-20 03:56:40	dave_64	huh?  i just installed vbox a few days ago and it worked out of the box
2010-08-20 03:58:23	iRedWar	I think if I got rid of the version i have of VBOX right now, prior to the updates, I mmight now have the problems I have had.  I am able to make it work, but I have to  keep loading kernal mods every boot
2010-08-20 03:58:36	iRedWar	But just asking if anyone has a preference for Sabayon
2010-08-20 03:59:06	dave_64	add the modules to a config file....let me check which one
2010-08-20 04:00:17	dave_64	add to /etc/conf.d/modules : modules="vboxdrv vboxnetadp vboxnetflt"
2010-08-20 04:01:15	iRedWar	yeah.. Im having to mess around with that. I got it from the forum, it works but have to do it every boot up
2010-08-20 04:02:00	iRedWar	But, I am looking to try others, just for the heck of it, I just did not know if there was in particular. I already loaded up virt_manager, and I m lworking on it as we speak
2010-08-20 04:02:07	dave_64	did you add that line at the end of the file, on a line by itself?  were you root?
2010-08-20 04:02:24	iRedWar	Yes I was root, and I added it on a line on its own
2010-08-20 04:02:55	iRedWar	So not sure what I am doing wrong there, I just saw someone else had the same problem, .. the line is there.. so not sure why i Have to keep loading it in terminal
2010-08-20 04:03:03	dave_64	maybe you need to add a carriage return after adding the line
2010-08-20 04:03:04	iRedWar	But its ok, I mean, it runs great when I do it
2010-08-20 04:03:22	iRedWar	That is a good idea, I did not think about that, is that how yours looks like>
2010-08-20 04:03:23	iRedWar	?

2010-08-20 04:05:37	dave_64	all i know is that there are some config files that need a carriage return after the last line.  in fact, i messed up my install (WINXP) and installed it as root, so i didnt get around to adding anything to modules
2010-08-20 04:06:24	dave_64	my keyboard has a stuck key ...the shift key is stuck down, so i have to type with caps lock on
2010-08-20 04:06:58	iRedWar	dave_64 I am trying to mess around with WINXP x86 sp 3, but I keep getting the error, ISO not bootable.  Looked up some forums,and ppl were having problems.  I dont know if  I was in root.  But the error actually is no bootable media is found
2010-08-20 04:07:08	iRedWar	I was able to ge tFedora12 to work though
2010-08-20 04:07:10	dave_64	humidity is off the chart around here this past two months
2010-08-20 04:07:19	iRedWar	Where are you at dave?
2010-08-20 04:07:28	iRedWar	Im in FLorida, its pretty hot out here
2010-08-20 04:07:35	iRedWar	Humid  uggh
2010-08-20 04:07:41	dave_64	iowa
2010-08-20 04:07:48	iRedWar	stay cool budy
2010-08-20 04:07:57	iRedWar	Its hot and sticky out here
2010-08-20 04:08:10	genfool	dave_64,  I find that if I do not spill beer on the kb, the keys do not stick.
2010-08-20 04:08:34	dave_64	iRedWar: type    modprobe vboxdrv      before trying to install
2010-08-20 04:08:36	iRedWar	I find if I spill keys on the keyboard, that my computer runs faster
2010-08-20 04:08:57	iRedWar	dave_64 right before the install
2010-08-20 04:08:58	iRedWar	?
2010-08-20 04:09:16	iRedWar	Spill beer
2010-08-20 04:09:20	iRedWar	I just saw that
2010-08-20 04:09:21	iRedWar	doh
2010-08-20 04:09:29	dave_64	anytime after linux is booted.....yeah,  beer...heh, heh
2010-08-20 04:12:58	dave_64	are you sure your cdrom is mounted?
2010-08-20 04:13:35	iRedWar	Yeah it is.  I am working on it now, but I actually want to save this install.. and really test out virt manager have you used it yet?
2010-08-20 04:13:54	dave_64	no
2010-08-20 04:14:00	iRedWar	that command you gave me btw is what I use  when I first work it
2010-08-20 04:14:14	iRedWar	But XP ISO, checksum is good, not sure what the deal is there
2010-08-20 04:14:32	iRedWar	I also have some ISO with seven 32 bit, but that failed too initially
2010-08-20 04:14:47	iRedWar	But that was before I did the additional lines.. So as we speak I m working on adding it
2010-08-20 04:15:20	iRedWar	But I think Im going to try to use Virt_manager with 2008 Server guest and Sabayon as HOst
2010-08-20 04:16:22	iRedWar	XP Ill throw int here
2010-08-20 04:16:54	iRedWar	I noticed no how to, if I get it to work the way Im hoping, I would like to add to the forums... so I just submit it right?
2010-08-20 04:17:09	iRedWar	(virt_manager how to)
2010-08-20 04:17:21	iRedWar	Very scant what is out there
2010-08-20 04:17:23	dave_64	i don't know much about virtualization.  I just played with it a few times,  and recently installed winxp to see if i could still do it
2010-08-20 04:18:04	genfool	you could add it to the wiki, under "how to"
2010-08-20 04:19:44	iRedWar	Awesome, Im taking notes right now, so I got it on my Tomboy, and as I get through it I ll keep doing it
2010-08-20 04:19:47	iRedWar	ththen post
2010-08-20 04:20:17	iRedWar	I think this would be very useful, especially for those that are looking for alternative hypervisors
2010-08-20 04:20:24	iRedWar	or virtualizers I mena
2010-08-20 04:20:25	dave_64	yeah, i see vbox is already in the wiki howto
2010-08-20 04:20:50	iRedWar	yeah, it was very helpful, its where i got also that vbox moddrv stuff
2010-08-20 04:20:51	iRedWar	also
2010-08-20 04:21:41	iRedWar	So that was very helpful. Just slightly buggy, just not sure why I am having the hard time with the XP ISO, but I did have screwed up repos before, and it appears, that I may actually need to update  VOBX anyways
2010-08-20 04:21:45	iRedWar	VBOX
2010-08-20 04:22:10	iRedWar	Meanwhile, last night I installed virt_manager, with QEMU and working the modules part as we speak
2010-08-20 04:22:37	dave_64	is the winxp in the form of an iso?  it should be an image
2010-08-20 04:25:05	iRedWar	ISO are not images?
2010-08-20 04:25:16	iRedWar	What am I misisng?
2010-08-20 04:25:50	dave_64	if the file is of the form, winxp.iso    it is not an image....it (the .iso file) needs to be burned as an image
2010-08-20 04:26:05	iRedWar	This was burned into my CD then I moved it
2010-08-20 04:26:19	iRedWar	I used ISO BURN
2010-08-20 04:26:22	iRedWar	But ok
2010-08-20 04:26:28	dave_64	is the cd bootable
2010-08-20 04:26:38	iRedWar	Its bootable on its own yes
2010-08-20 04:27:02	dave_64	when you boot with the cd in place,  does it come up with the winxp installer?
2010-08-20 04:27:08	iRedWar	yes
2010-08-20 04:27:24	dave_64	ok, then it's an image...it should work with vbox
2010-08-20 04:27:46	iRedWar	yup that is what is throwing me for the loop there.   But... we will see
2010-08-20 04:27:55	iRedWar	I m working on it now
2010-08-20 04:28:11	dave_64	how are you starting vbox?
2010-08-20 04:29:26	iRedWar	with the modprobe
2010-08-20 04:29:39	iRedWar	It works with the other ISO's when I do that
2010-08-20 04:29:47	iRedWar	including my server 2003
2010-08-20 04:30:29	dave_64	i mean, are you starting vbox from a terminal with the command: VirtualBox
2010-08-20 04:31:37	iRedWar	I was running it form terminal before
2010-08-20 04:31:42	iRedWar	from
2010-08-20 04:31:54	iRedWar	Let me run it, I was just editing
2010-08-20 04:31:58	iRedWar	with VIM
2010-08-20 04:32:28	dave_64	and did you type: modprobe vboxdrv        at a root terminal before running VirtualBox    (at a user terminal_

2010-08-20 04:48:11	iRedWar	To make it work I usually have to do this...   for m in vbox{drv,netadp,netflt}; do modprobe $m; done
2010-08-20 04:48:36	iRedWar	Now, here is the thing.... I noticed in the equo search...   I have a lot of not installs, at least listed
2010-08-20 04:48:55	iRedWar	How about if we remove all instances of virtualbox and do another install
2010-08-20 04:49:21	iRedWar	maybe this is just a matter of what I was experiencing with some kernal issues that I just recently resovled
2010-08-20 04:49:40	dave_64	iRedWar: just run: equo remove virtualbox      then run: equo install virtualbox-bin
2010-08-20 04:51:27	iRedWar	equo remove virtual box asked about whch one... so should i just remove each one?
2010-08-20 04:51:40	iRedWar	Or remove all other the virtualbox bin
2010-08-20 04:52:19	dave_64	man,  now i'm getting confused   :)     you're call
2010-08-20 04:54:09	dave_64	all i know is my "notes"  suggest installing virtualbox-bin    and then do the other things cadmus showed you
2010-08-20 04:54:12	dave_64	?? vbox
2010-08-20 04:54:13	@|Cadmus|	vbox[1]: To configure virtualbox, after installation do the following
2010-08-20 04:54:15	@|Cadmus|	vbox[2]: modprobe vboxdrv ; modprobe vboxnetadp ; modprobe vboxnetflt
2010-08-20 04:54:17	@|Cadmus|	vbox[3]: then add the following line to the end of /etc/conf.d/modules
2010-08-20 04:54:19	@|Cadmus|	vbox[4]: modules="vboxdrv vboxnetadp vboxnetflt"
2010-08-20 04:56:19	dave_64	the first 2 items are to run vbox without rebooting...the last two items are to allow you to run vbox without loading the modules after every reboot
2010-08-20 04:56:38	iRedWar	Ok.. Im going to do it

2010-08-21 14:20:53	sabayonweb_13423	Afternoon. I was wondering if there are any recommended sizes when installing with manual partitioning? Total available space is 100 GB. Thank you.
2010-08-21 14:22:19	sabayonweb_13423	The system is a Toshiba laptop with 4 GB ram (32bit memory chip).
2010-08-21 14:25:46	sabayonweb_13423	Or should I just set / to use all of it, apart from 8 GB for the swap?
2010-08-21 14:26:57	--	sabayonweb_13423 is now known as N-S
2010-08-21 14:28:03	CaptainSifff	Well, I can report what I have for my laptop...
2010-08-21 14:28:15	CaptainSifff	but that's not necessarily recommended...
2010-08-21 14:29:32	N-S	CaptainSifff: Well, I'm just asking, so I don't set anything silly, that in the end will cause me problems.
2010-08-21 14:29:42	CaptainSifff	I have 100MB of boot partition. and ...
2010-08-21 14:30:07	CaptainSifff	I tried out lvm, so I have an lvm partition that is 105GB...
2010-08-21 14:31:19	CaptainSifff	when I find out how I partitioned it, I let you know...
2010-08-21 14:31:23	CaptainSifff	argh...
2010-08-21 14:32:44	CaptainSifff	It's about 20GB for root '/' and 80GB for home
2010-08-21 14:33:23	N-S	I'll just go for swap and /. single user on the system, so it'll be fine.
2010-08-21 14:33:29	N-S	thank you CaptainSifff
2010-08-21 14:33:56	CaptainSifff	ah and 1GB of swap
2010-08-21 14:34:06	-->	[Enrico] (~chiccoroc@gentoo/contributor/Enrico) has joined #sabayon
2010-08-21 14:34:13	CaptainSifff	with swap you should be careful on a laptop
2010-08-21 14:34:28	N-S	CaptainSifff: how come?
2010-08-21 14:34:57	CaptainSifff	the hibernate scripts can use the swap partition to store the contents of the RAM when you hibernate your system
2010-08-21 14:35:12	CaptainSifff	so you should make swap as large as you physical RAM
2010-08-21 14:35:23	N-S	yup, done
2010-08-21 14:35:47	CaptainSifff	I'll have to fix this somewhen on mine...

2010-08-21 14:58:06	sabayonweb_21594	no
2010-08-21 14:58:44	CaptainSifff	you should first do equo update

2010-08-21 15:12:52	CaptainSifff	this should be ok, I think, because you're on a new system and haven't configured anything yet.
2010-08-21 15:13:23	sabayonweb_21594	no reboot or anything
2010-08-21 15:13:32	CaptainSifff	no.

2010-08-21 19:04:34	CaptainSifff	hmm... sabayon is a rolling update distribution there's constantly something to update(ok, that's a bit of a stretch...)
2010-08-21 19:04:43	lythandrel	sabayonweb_21594: stuff on linux is done mainly through package managers..
2010-08-21 19:04:51	CaptainSifff	how far are you?

2010-08-21 19:07:08	sabayonweb_21594	i think its installing everything
2010-08-21 19:09:42	CaptainSifff	:-D
2010-08-21 19:13:00	sabayonweb_21594	yep installing 160 of 556
2010-08-21 19:13:54	CaptainSifff	will be away for a couple of hours the roadmap now is equo update then equo conf update then equo install nm-applet and then equo install ndiswrapper. After that you need that tutorial from a couple of hours ago, about setting up ndiswrapper.
2010-08-21 19:14:09	CaptainSifff	Good Luck!

2010-08-22 01:44:05	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487: if you have a spare mouse, see if the behaviour is the same.
2010-08-22 01:44:33	Azerthoth|D	rather, from your description it sounds like the first stage of a dying mouse
2010-08-22 01:44:35	sabayonweb_55487	checking...
2010-08-22 01:44:57	lythandrel	Azerthoth|D: or a change in the kernel usb handling.
2010-08-22 01:45:15	lythandrel	Azerthoth|D: or a weird driver with a power saving mode enabled.
2010-08-22 01:45:38	lythandrel	or a mouse with a powersaving mode enabled.
2010-08-22 01:45:43	lythandrel	and just odd timing.
2010-08-22 01:45:51	Azerthoth|D	USB mouse with powersave?
2010-08-22 01:47:40	sabayonweb_55487	connected spare logitech MX500 - works fine. But when I connect that doggy one to the other sabayon box (non patched for last few weeks) it work fine too.
2010-08-22 01:48:24	sabayonweb_55487	something has been injected to my system with the latest patch....

2010-08-22 01:51:50	sabayonweb_55487	sorry, it is probably my english. Lets re-frase it. Razer (that one which looks like is dying) worked fine until today (before yesterday's update) . It works fine when connected to 2nd sabayon PC, so it does not look like dying mouse
2010-08-22 01:53:18	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487: what kernel is on the other box, and what kernel is on the box where the mouse is a problem.
2010-08-22 01:54:52	sabayonweb_55487	problem one: 2.6.34-sabayon. Good one: 2.6.31-sabayon
2010-08-22 01:59:32	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487: i'm baffled on this one, and my attention span is nil today.  i'm going to ask you to submit all those pastebins to our bugtracker... bugs.sabayon.org
2010-08-22 01:59:56	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487 - including the fact that it works fine with the earlier kernel.
2010-08-22 02:00:10	sabayonweb_55487	sure I will
2010-08-22 02:00:44	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487: you may also want to submit a copy of tht report to the manufacturer - some of them are good about linux support and may have a suggestion themselves...
2010-08-22 02:01:28	lythandrel	and overkill - but overkill is better than undereporting - kernel.orgs bugtracker and xorgs - the last one is probably unnecessary
2010-08-22 02:02:05	sabayonweb_55487	I'll give a couple tests tomorrow at work. I've got the same mouse connected to my office Sabayon box.

2010-08-22 02:18:04	BitCrypt	how come i have the directory privoxy in /etc with a new clean sl x64 K installation? the same goes for john.conf (jontheripper config file) and /var/log/tor? according to the various portage utilities these files aren't owned by any installed package? why do new systems have this cruft? am i missing something?
2010-08-22 02:20:01	Radtoo	Hm. I don't have a good overview about what files are there at install time, but possibly these are packages that get removed during install, depending on what option you choose.
2010-08-22 02:21:31	BitCrypt	the same goes for .xchat2 hidden directory inside my home directory, yet again the package isn't installed

2010-08-22 02:29:06	BitCrypt	Radtoo: well i noticed this with earlier sl versions too, i didn't bugreport is because i thought the same as you, also i can't be the first to notice this? i hate to compare with other distro's, but a clean debian install has a clean home directory withouth a leftover .fluxbox, xchat2 etc which i don't expect with a KDE install
2010-08-22 02:30:01	BitCrypt	maybe i should post it on the mailinglists because i really want to know the answer
2010-08-22 02:30:08	Radtoo	I can't know that. Maybe hundreds noticed it but no one was bothered by it. :)
2010-08-22 02:31:16	BitCrypt	well the developers should have noticed it and be bothered by it from QA standpoint
2010-08-22 02:31:41	BitCrypt	it's unacceptable IMO, but maybe i'm totaly wrong here
2010-08-22 02:32:27	Radtoo	As for the .fluxbox etc, they are not leftovers. check /etc/skel/ ...
2010-08-22 02:32:55	Radtoo	That's the proposed default user dir layout. You sure can report if you don't like something about it, but its intentional
2010-08-22 02:33:10	BitCrypt	Radtoo: i choose KDE, not .fluxbox, .fluxbox has no reason to be in the skeleton scripts anyway if I choose KDE
2010-08-22 02:33:37	Radtoo	It does. Sabayon's theming and so on is there.
2010-08-22 02:34:53	Radtoo	If you don't like it, delete it...

2010-08-22 02:35:46	BitCrypt	so what is .xchat2 doeing in my home directory? it has obviously nothing todo with theming, and i didn't install .xchat
2010-08-22 02:36:07	BitCrypt	Radtoo: you don't get the point, if these simple things are overlooked, why would i trust the developers of this distro anyway?
2010-08-22 02:36:35	Radtoo	Sure it does. Default usernames and server settings to make the "get live help now" link work and stuff, I bet.
2010-08-22 02:36:44	BitCrypt	Radtoo: install debian with X DE and you won't find all this cruft laying around
2010-08-22 02:37:22	BitCrypt	or funtoo
2010-08-22 02:37:24	Radtoo	And?
2010-08-22 02:37:27	BitCrypt	or vanilla gentoo etc etc
2010-08-22 02:37:48	Radtoo	Sabayon is neither of them, kind of the point here.
2010-08-22 02:38:00	Radtoo	Some choices are different, otherwise you'd not need a different distro.
2010-08-22 02:38:46	BitCrypt	no it's gentoo testing with an overlay, but i guess nobody cares if system is a mess, every file should be accountable by the package manager
2010-08-22 02:39:01	BitCrypt	except for log files, tmp and no what
2010-08-22 02:39:13	Radtoo	no, even in gentoo there's a hands-off policy for /etc and default files in /etc/skel/ ...
2010-08-22 02:39:25	sabayonuser2	I am having a problem, my sound is really low and my alsamixer only shows the Master, I know there is normally Master and Front, and that is normally the problem on other OS'es, is there a way to access all of the levels?
2010-08-22 02:39:44	Radtoo	But you don't need to like that, I don't really care. I just tell you, it's intentional and I can also tell you, no one other than you got upset about it so far... or had problems with it.
2010-08-22 02:39:48	BitCrypt	Radtoo: if i extract a stage tarball it doesn't contain jontheripper or privoxy by defaul
2010-08-22 02:39:52	Radtoo	None that I saw here.
2010-08-22 02:40:02	Radtoo	Sure it doesn't, but if you install and then uninstall it again...
2010-08-22 02:40:13	Radtoo	 /etc gets left over.
2010-08-22 02:40:20	BitCrypt	Radtoo: yes than i can understand it, but now i'm not sure
2010-08-22 02:41:28	Radtoo	sabayonuser2: hm, maybe alsamixer -c1 or -c2 or such? (multiple sound cards / virtual sound cards?)
2010-08-22 02:42:27	sabayonuser2	Radtoo: Thank you for pointing me in the right direction. I got it.
2010-08-22 02:42:49	Radtoo	sabayonuser2: nice. :)
2010-08-22 02:43:05	BitCrypt	Radtoo: and why do you think it's not intentional?
2010-08-22 02:44:56	BitCrypt	Radtoo: so i install 5.3 and the installation image contains tor and privoxy and the uninstalls them after the first equo update? so the install image is wrong?
2010-08-22 02:44:58	Radtoo	BitCrypt: Did I say such a thing? I actually think I mostly said things were intentional additions or a consequence of how things are done on Gentoo.
2010-08-22 02:45:22	Radtoo	BitCrypt: Actually, I think it even uninstalls things during install. I think it deploys a snapshot first, then removes undesired packages...
2010-08-22 02:46:29	BitCrypt	Radtoo: it shouldn't be in the initial snapshot then, or is there a general snapshots with gets modified during install for a K, G install?
2010-08-22 02:46:52	BitCrypt	err, which
2010-08-22 02:47:03	Radtoo	BitCrypt: K/G are different but I think there is a general snapshot for the different install target and it gets modified.
2010-08-22 02:47:43	BitCrypt	Radtoo: ok

2010-08-22 07:24:01	@|Cadmus|	wicd: First, make sure wicd is installed, then as root perform the following: 'rc-update add wicd default ; rc-update del NetworkManager ; /etc/init.d/NetworkManager stop ; /etc/init.d/wicd start' then as normal user you can start wicd-client to connect. It is recommended to add wicd-client to autostart as handled by your desktop environment

2010-08-22 11:55:56	inaeth	sabayonweb_68659: Onboard nVidia chipsets should already be detected by the kernel. What is the resolution and alpha masking that it's loading your X session at?
2010-08-22 11:56:48	Radtoo	sabayonweb_11401: apparently not... anyhow, it appears this uses ffmpeg. Its not in sabayon's package manager, though. May I suggest to use avidemux or some other alternative that is in sabayon's package manager, or using ffmpeg from the command line?
2010-08-22 11:57:24	Radtoo	The latter isn't actually hard if you use ffmpeg preset files (.ffpreset, there's some floating around on the 'net and ffmpeg ships with x264 ones)

2010-08-22 11:59:22	sabayonweb_11401	im not familiar with ffmpeg... does ffmpeg already installd on our system by default or we need to install it?
2010-08-22 11:59:50	Radtoo	I am not sure. Might already be installed... a lot of applications use it. But it's a command line tool.
2010-08-22 12:00:26	inaeth	sabayonweb_68659: Um.... that xorg is really messed up. You didn't specify a video driver to load, so X is resorting to the default VGA drivers.
2010-08-22 12:01:21	Radtoo	Quite easy to use with presets, though. "ffmpeg -vcodec libx264 -vpre normal -i <input file> -o <output file>"... change the preset and the encoding settings change. Even so, you might not need to use it at all, avidemux is very powerful
2010-08-22 12:03:38	sabayonweb_68659	hmm... driver "nv" isnt correct? or how i specify the driver?

2010-08-22 21:39:56	genfool	glide,  did you actually do the update? I got .33 and .35 in my update today...2 for the price of 1
2010-08-22 21:40:00	glide	dyingmuppet: why isn't my build picking up 2.6.35?  any ideas?
2010-08-22 21:40:09	glide	my other sabayon machine has it
2010-08-22 21:40:28	dyingmuppet	hmm, I haven't noticed that though
2010-08-22 21:40:52	dyingmuppet	one sec, and I'll check it for myself
2010-08-22 21:42:53	tyr12	picking up?
2010-08-22 21:43:00	glide	i'm not getting 2.6.35 in a new slot.  eselect kernel list only shows 2.6.34
2010-08-22 21:43:04	tyr12	i actually have to type 'equo install linux-sabayon' for it to show up
2010-08-22 21:43:05	tyr12	ahh
2010-08-22 21:43:51	tyr12	with the exception of eselect defaulting to xorg during the most recent batch of updates, its always worked fine for me - hence, no knowledge of how to troubleshoot it.

2010-08-22 21:45:50	 *	tyr12 nods at dyingmuppet
2010-08-22 21:46:29	tyr12	what i really want to know, and what i really haven't bothered troubleshooting, is why my work laptop wireless card is not seen by iwconfig/ifconfig (but is by lspci) - its officially supported by 34 and 35 (=
2010-08-22 21:46:40	tyr12	but again, i haven't bothered troubleshooting, so don't help.
2010-08-22 21:46:45	dyingmuppet	glide: though, its safe to install the .35 kernel you have to be sure to update the dependend packages too
2010-08-22 21:47:06	glide	so equo query revdeps linux-sabayon?
2010-08-22 21:47:07	dyingmuppet	tyr12: maybe a faulty/buggy driver?
2010-08-22 21:47:53	dyingmuppet	glide: well, I've never used it that way, I used the hard part and equo search #2.6.35 to get al installed packages with a 2.6.35 tag
2010-08-22 21:48:04	tyr12	dyingmuppet: don't have to install a package, actually, for that card.  i tried.
2010-08-22 21:48:13	tyr12	and downloaded firmware, etc.
2010-08-22 21:48:59	dyingmuppet	than it could be possible to be a faulty driver, although its included in the kernel
2010-08-22 21:49:20	tyr12	id boot into linux on it and test, but i have to do work right now, and thats on the windows half stilll
2010-08-22 21:49:27	glide	well, i know my superio driver borks on loading
2010-08-22 21:50:01	dyingmuppet	tyr12: no problem, there's plenty of time later... hopefully xD
2010-08-22 21:50:19	glide	looks like nvidia driver problems
2010-08-22 21:50:31	tyr12	eselect opengl list ?
2010-08-22 21:50:38	glide	i just reinstalled nvidia drivers, and i see it doing stuff with 2.6.35-sabayon
2010-08-22 21:50:41	tyr12	as mine was defaulted to xorg after the recent updates
2010-08-22 21:51:54	glide	tyr12: was set to xorg-x11
2010-08-22 21:52:05	glide	strange, nvidia drivers pulled in 2.6.35
2010-08-22 21:52:07	tyr12	glide: yep.  for me, it shouldn't've been.
2010-08-22 21:52:30	dyingmuppet	glide, thats because eselect automatically selects the last installed kernel
2010-08-22 21:52:47	glide	now i see 2.6.35 in eselect kernel list

2010-08-22 22:02:18	tyr12	im running 2.6.35, using nvidia-drivers slotted for 2.6.35.  equo upgrade --pretend wants to pull nvidia-drivers and linux-sabayon for 2.6.32

2010-08-22 22:48:59	Sublime`	no, 32
2010-08-22 22:49:39	lxnay	exec format error clearly denotes something related to weird with your hook (inner_chroot_script or whatever) executable
2010-08-22 22:49:43	lxnay	fix it
2010-08-22 22:50:26	Sublime`	mkay, running again with prechroot
2010-08-22 22:50:36	lxnay	exec format error (error 8) is usually generated when you're running an executable on an unsupported architecture
2010-08-22 22:51:40	lxnay	or your script shebang is wrong
2010-08-22 22:52:04	lxnay	definitely not a bug in our software

2010-08-22 22:59:16	Diddlebug	Hey all.
2010-08-22 22:59:46	Diddlebug	Question: What is the most expedient way to backup my system? I finally have everything working just right (famous last words, I know)...
2010-08-22 23:00:07	Sublime`	Diddlebug: tar
2010-08-22 23:00:09	Diddlebug	Is there an equivalent of "ghosting" as there is with Windows?
2010-08-22 23:00:14	DHalens	luckybackup ?
2010-08-22 23:00:34	DHalens	luckybackup uses rsync to copy data iirc
2010-08-22 23:01:21	Diddlebug	Does the backup require the exact amount of diskpace currently allotted? That is, I have a system installed on a 200GB harddrive, with 6GB Swap, 55GB System, and remaining GB in Home
2010-08-22 23:01:35	Diddlebug	Luckybackup, gmm.
2010-08-22 23:01:36	Sublime`	Diddlebug: no
2010-08-22 23:01:56	Sublime`	not if you tar
2010-08-22 23:02:10	Diddlebug	How do I tar? with LuckyBackup?
2010-08-22 23:02:25	Diddlebug	Is there a GUI that uses Tar compression?
2010-08-22 23:02:44	Diddlebug	or rather, for use with tar compression, i mean.
2010-08-22 23:02:47	DHalens	with a simple system like the ones we propose, actually you're doing something like copy and paste. If you mess partitions, you won't be able to restore them
2010-08-22 23:03:09	Diddlebug	When you say "mess" partitions, what do you mean?
2010-08-22 23:03:29	Diddlebug	How do you guys back up your system?
2010-08-22 23:03:35	Sublime`	don't
2010-08-22 23:03:40	DHalens	we don't :P
2010-08-22 23:03:51	Diddlebug	ha, really?
2010-08-22 23:04:06	DHalens	i mean like if your hard drive breaks or something like that
2010-08-22 23:04:27	Sublime`	DHalens: i only backup pictures, movies, and music on an external hdd
2010-08-22 23:04:29	Sublime`	that's all
2010-08-22 23:04:35	Diddlebug	So you are saying, there is no actual way to make an image of a system to reimage?
2010-08-22 23:04:57	Diddlebug	Ie, I bought a new harddrive and wanted to simply deploy my old system on the new drive.
2010-08-22 23:05:03	Sublime`	there is
2010-08-22 23:05:06	Sublime`	but cba
2010-08-22 23:05:12	Diddlebug	CBA?

2010-08-22 23:05:27	DHalens	of course there is, but think that at the same time you copy a whole partition, system is writing data on them... in other words, you can't backup while running your system
2010-08-22 23:05:28	Sublime`	it's easier/better to just reinstall
2010-08-22 23:06:01	Sublime`	also Diddlebug look into RAID 1
2010-08-22 23:06:14	Diddlebug	Yeah, I thought about RAID mirroring.
2010-08-22 23:06:28	Diddlebug	DHalens, I'm surprised this can't be done.
2010-08-22 23:06:53	Sublime`	this can be done, we dont see a reason
2010-08-22 23:06:57	DHalens	well, i've heard btrfs can do things like that....
2010-08-22 23:07:07	Diddlebug	For enterprise deployment as an example
2010-08-22 23:07:47	dyingmuppet	then you can also make a spinoff with the software you need, and make an iso to install on all of the systems
2010-08-22 23:08:01	Diddlebug	Good point.
2010-08-22 23:08:01	Sublime`	yeah, what im trying to do
2010-08-22 23:08:08	Sublime`	i'll let you know if it works >:(
2010-08-22 23:08:17	Diddlebug	I guess that's the next step in my Linux Journey.
2010-08-22 23:08:27	Diddlebug	I just started using Linux a little over a month ago.

2010-08-22 23:09:32	Sublime`	lol....
2010-08-22 23:09:38	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: then I guess its better to first play a little and don't get too much important data on there :P
2010-08-22 23:09:47	Diddlebug	Very true!
2010-08-22 23:09:51	Sublime`	lxnay, dyingmuppet: seems to be working, but it's not done yet so don't quote me on that
2010-08-22 23:09:53	dyingmuppet	maybe some external drive or something
2010-08-22 23:09:57	Diddlebug	But I've already realized that I stopped using Windows
2010-08-22 23:10:15	 *	dyingmuppet holds its fingers crossed *
2010-08-22 23:10:15	Diddlebug	I booted to Windows and there were 8 trillion updates and such, and it made me realize how long its been since i booted to it.
2010-08-22 23:10:30	dyingmuppet	ghehe
2010-08-22 23:10:34	Diddlebug	By the way, why was there an update to reinstall the 2.5.34 kernal?
2010-08-22 23:10:39	Diddlebug	I'm sorry, 2.6.34?
2010-08-22 23:10:42	Sublime`	i get more updates with sabayon than windows so....
2010-08-22 23:11:02	Diddlebug	Sublime, for sure, but they aren't "critical error" bugs
2010-08-22 23:11:02	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: because there was a patch build for the kernel to fix some bugs
2010-08-22 23:11:13	Diddlebug	haha, nice timing
2010-08-22 23:11:24	dyingmuppet	and they aren't as big as M$ updates

2010-08-23 00:18:03	Diddlebug	There's some peculiar price issue with RAM though. 2GB modules are cheap while 4GB modules are obscenely expensive.

2010-08-23 00:25:10	dyingmuppet	also virtualbox will show you a bar from green to red that indicates the amount thats save to use

2010-08-23 00:27:24	Diddlebug	or is Linux efficient in how it uses mem?
2010-08-23 00:28:09	dyingmuppet	Linux in itself is pretty efficient in useing its memory, in most cases it caches up all the ram to have faster access to it
2010-08-23 00:29:05	dyingmuppet	swap, nowadays, isn't really needed anymore, but it's always good to have some to be sure

2010-08-23 00:35:44	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: for the size of a swap drive, in the early days the said to at least a double amount of the memory you have installed, nowadays 2GB is more than enough
2010-08-23 00:37:44	Diddlebug	Sublime, that's a shame - guilt breeds humility.
2010-08-23 00:38:10	Diddlebug	dyingmuppet - can I alter swap size after installation?
2010-08-23 00:38:12	Radtoo	Diddlebug: I often do 0 swap on installations with more RAM. Linux may be clever in guessing what to put in swap, usually, but there's just not an aweful lot even it can do about RAM being in the order of 1000x+ faster than a classic hdd
2010-08-23 00:38:34	Diddlebug	Ahh...

2010-08-23 01:01:16	dyingmuppet	you first have to turn it off before you can use a diskmanager to resize the swap drive

2010-08-23 01:06:32	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: same here
2010-08-23 01:06:33	Diddlebug	Can anyone explain why my driver install looks like this? http://imgur.com/XqZ0h.png
2010-08-23 01:06:51	Sublime`	no offense to the developers, but can you explain why you're using sulfur?
2010-08-23 01:06:53	Sublime`	lol
2010-08-23 01:06:54	dyingmuppet	Sublime`: hmm, i'm not sure, is it still a chroot like situation thats been build to a iso?
2010-08-23 01:07:02	Sublime`	well, it built the ISO
2010-08-23 01:07:22	Sublime`	but I want to customize it a little more than it already is, like edit the grub, disable xdm on boot, etc
2010-08-23 01:07:40	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: because older versiones will be removed and nvidia-drivers-195.36.31 will be installed
2010-08-23 01:07:55	Diddlebug	But even after updating, it remains like this
2010-08-23 01:08:01	Diddlebug	That's the issue.
2010-08-23 01:08:08	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: maybe you selected it that way?
2010-08-23 01:08:15	Diddlebug	It says everything is up to date, but it never looks fully installed.
2010-08-23 01:08:37	Diddlebug	I actually tried to select to reinstall the driver, and after reinstallation, this is how it looks in Entroy.

2010-08-23 01:26:49	marcusironfist	diddlebug, the hd died hard a few months ago...  been stuck with live cd/dvd's for a while...
2010-08-23 01:27:07	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: mount
2010-08-23 01:27:24	dyingmuppet	if i'm right
2010-08-23 01:27:44	Diddlebug	marcus...wow. HDs are cheap, have you considered getting one? I know that doesn't answer the issue
2010-08-23 01:28:16	marcusironfist	umm, yeah, i've looked...  the lt is a few years old, and uses ide...  every store i know sells only SATA...
2010-08-23 01:28:21	Diddlebug	yup, no swap shown
2010-08-23 01:28:27	Diddlebug	how can I make this permant?
2010-08-23 01:28:45	marcusironfist	take the swap entry out of /etc/fstab
2010-08-23 01:29:01	Diddlebug	I have the system set up on an LVM inside the 200gb HD
2010-08-23 01:29:03	dyingmuppet	exactly
2010-08-23 01:29:30	marcusironfist	lol, i'm no linux n00b, but sometimes there are still things that catch me off-guard...
2010-08-23 01:29:55	dyingmuppet	yeah, LVM is one of the parts I didn't really messed with yet...
2010-08-23 01:30:28	marcusironfist	doesn't matter if you use lvm or not, diddlebug, just take the swap entry out of the fstab file, then you can reformat that partition for a usable fs...
2010-08-23 01:30:29	Diddlebug	Okay, I deleted the line. God I hope I didn't kill my system
2010-08-23 01:30:46	marcusironfist	is the swap inside or outside the lvm?
2010-08-23 01:30:49	Diddlebug	got it, thanks marcus
2010-08-23 01:30:50	Diddlebug	inside
2010-08-23 01:30:57	marcusironfist	lol
2010-08-23 01:31:08	Diddlebug	why is that a stupid newb mistake?
2010-08-23 01:31:11	marcusironfist	when i've done lvm on a few machines, i ALWAYS keep swap outside lvm
2010-08-23 01:31:29	Diddlebug	When I installed Sabayon, I didn't know my a** from my elbow
2010-08-23 01:31:37	Sublime`	why does cp take up so much memory
2010-08-23 01:31:37	Diddlebug	I've only been using for a month or so...
2010-08-23 01:31:40	dyingmuppet	thats more of a user prefereability
2010-08-23 01:31:51	dyingmuppet	minus last e
2010-08-23 01:32:07	Diddlebug	I realize that it might have made more sense to install /home on a separate partition too.
2010-08-23 01:32:08	marcusironfist	i make a 50mb for /boot as partition 1, 500mb-1gb for swap as partition 2, then the rest of the space on all involved drives for the lvm
2010-08-23 01:32:30	dyingmuppet	Sublime`: cp is caching it first into ram before moving it for real
2010-08-23 01:32:33	Diddlebug	I kept it inside LVM because I wanted the entire thing encrypted
2010-08-23 01:32:39	Sublime`	that's so gay
2010-08-23 01:32:44	Sublime`	froze my whole system
2010-08-23 01:32:47	Azerthoth	it doesnt need to be in an LVM to be encrypted
2010-08-23 01:32:53	dyingmuppet	well, at least caching it not really on ram probably
2010-08-23 01:33:02	Diddlebug	but wouldn't I have to input an extra key at boot?
2010-08-23 01:33:20	dyingmuppet	brb, smoke
2010-08-23 01:33:20	marcusironfist	umm, dude, swap is nearly impossible to read unless you know the swap functions of the kernel intimately...
2010-08-23 01:33:34	Azerthoth	encrypted or unencrypted, it only takes passphrase once
2010-08-23 01:33:53	Diddlebug	Like I said, I didn't (and apparently still don't) know my a$$ from my elbow about these things.
2010-08-23 01:33:55	marcusironfist	and a swap partition doesn't store data like a regular one does
2010-08-23 01:34:16	Diddlebug	I always thought a swap was the vulnerability in a system
2010-08-23 01:34:22	marcusironfist	can you read the contents of the windows swap file?
2010-08-23 01:34:27	Diddlebug	I think so.
2010-08-23 01:34:31	Azerthoth	LVM just adds a layer of complexity, and honestly most people dont use it properly anyway
2010-08-23 01:34:42	Diddlebug	I think that's why there were programs to scrub the swap file
2010-08-23 01:34:43	marcusironfist	not in a human-readable way you can't
2010-08-23 01:34:52	Diddlebug	that's good to know.
2010-08-23 01:35:02	Diddlebug	What's the proper way to use LVM?
2010-08-23 01:35:11	marcusironfist	linux is 10000 times more secure than windows could ever dream of being
2010-08-23 01:35:15	Sublime`	Diddlebug: you're just full of dreams aren't you
2010-08-23 01:35:17	Diddlebug	I just saw it as equivalent to logical partitions in windows
2010-08-23 01:35:22	Sublime`	i think you and google would seriously be best friends
2010-08-23 01:35:30	Diddlebug	of dreams?
2010-08-23 01:35:38	Azerthoth	use of LVM is so that you can seamlessly add more room from other drives to make it appear that a partition is larger
2010-08-23 01:35:50	marcusironfist	exactly, Az
2010-08-23 01:36:02	Diddlebug	You mean have a volume run across mutliple physical drives
2010-08-23 01:36:08	marcusironfist	diddlebug, lvm is only effective on a machine with more than one drive
2010-08-23 01:36:08	Azerthoth	correct
2010-08-23 01:36:29	Diddlebug	Why then does Sabayon's default setup arrange the installation with an LVM setup?
2010-08-23 01:36:30	marcusironfist	if you only have one drive in the machine, lvm adds unneccessary overhead
2010-08-23 01:36:34	Diddlebug	even on a clean drive?
2010-08-23 01:36:39	Azerthoth	and it has a downside, if one drive or one partition dies, the whole thing dies, all of it

2010-08-23 01:37:41	Diddlebug	Again, why does Sabayon default to this even when installing on a single drive?
2010-08-23 01:37:57	Azerthoth	side effect of anaconda
2010-08-23 01:38:18	Diddlebug	Is there enough of a performance hit that it would be worth it for me to reinstall without LVM?

2010-08-23 01:52:33	Sublime`	wat is this orb thing
2010-08-23 01:52:53	Azerthoth	all LVM does on a single disc system is add a few steps if you have to get in and chroot into it
2010-08-23 01:53:11	Diddlebug	Another dream...
2010-08-23 01:53:22	Diddlebug	Can I ask: What type of encryption does the LUKS system use?
2010-08-23 01:53:22	Azerthoth	happily I wrote a script that handles that for you
2010-08-23 01:53:51	Azerthoth	dm-crypt, defaults to aes256
2010-08-23 01:53:52	Diddlebug	I saw that....how to automunt
2010-08-23 01:53:52	Diddlebug	its in the forums as a sticky, right?
2010-08-23 01:53:52	Azerthoth	yup

2010-08-23 01:53:55	Azerthoth	in the wiki there is a manual way too
2010-08-23 01:53:56	Diddlebug	I'll use your script, thanks :)
2010-08-23 02:12:47	marcusironfist	is there a way to make a live cd/dvd load files from a usb device during boot?  like maybe using the usb device as the /home?
2010-08-23 02:15:01	Diddlebug	Its pretty impressive that things like LUKS and on-the-fly decryption exist. I was watching a documentary on the the decryption of the german Enigma machines back in WWII
2010-08-23 02:24:05	Diddlebug	Brilliant stuff on all sides.

2010-08-23 02:24:54	Diddlebug	does the bios not support it?
