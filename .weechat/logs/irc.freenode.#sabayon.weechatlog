2010-08-15 15:55:04	DHalens	hmm... anyway, a few commands accept the --nocolor param so unless it's a big issue, you can live with that
2010-08-15 15:55:31	mr4m	i'm trying to change the text color for a boot splash which uses a white background.
2010-08-15 15:56:35	mr4m	The specified text color is ignored ecause of the global colouring.

2010-08-18 16:20:09	kiuma	hello, I've installed gnome-light, but now in both kde and gnome the screen becomes white after few seconds they've been started, how can I solve this ?
2010-08-18 16:36:18	DHalens	you updated the kernel or graphic drivers too and compiz is somehow failing to start
2010-08-18 16:37:03	user_	but  does sabayon use half of it for its internal purspose? I see only 36 allocated for my suage.
2010-08-18 16:39:08	user_	i know for ext4 it reserves some disk space for its use, but half of the disk is a little too much in the asking
2010-08-18 16:39:09	DHalens	user_: i see 36 for / and 36 for /home (that is, if i understand the lvm thing...)
2010-08-18 16:40:00	user_	is that normal?
2010-08-18 16:41:08	user_	i thought the root wont require that much
2010-08-18 16:41:27	DHalens	well, the one who assigned the space was you...
2010-08-18 16:41:49	DHalens	or at least, the one who told the partitioner to autoasign the space was you
2010-08-18 16:41:49	user_	LOL...well...all I did was a next, next, next bro
2010-08-18 16:42:33	DHalens	heh, that's the reason some devs want to add a next button for search and delete all data in the computer
2010-08-18 16:42:45	user_	i used the automatic partioner and just left at that, did not look into it with details. I guess I should reinstall with manual partition
2010-08-18 16:43:02	DHalens	you can resize the partitions
2010-08-18 16:43:21	DHalens	but don't ask me, i have no idea of how to do that with lvm
2010-08-18 16:43:40	user_	u made me jump off the seat bro...even i am scared of that stuff
2010-08-18 16:44:06	user_	well...not scared...for its a fresh install ...at the max all i have to do a fresh install again.
2010-08-18 16:44:40	DHalens	up to you but if you reinstall, please at least read what the installer says...
2010-08-18 16:44:55	user_	you betcha...better I do
2010-08-18 16:45:10	DHalens	once installed you can ignore anything and as long as you're not root user, you won't break it

2010-08-19 16:50:46	Phazorx	very lame question - how do i make it so copy buffer is shared between xorg and consoles?
2010-08-19 16:51:29	Phazorx	basicaly being able to paste things into console (/dev/tty kind of console, not xterm) which have been copied under X?
2010-08-19 17:04:51	Enlik	maybe xclip will do, I'm not sure. If you use it on tty, it would be needed to set -display option I think (or DISPLAY variable).
2010-08-19 17:05:17	Enlik	I was told about this tool on this channel,too :)

2010-08-19 17:11:09	Phazorx	so buffers are always shared and no special tool needed to be launched at copy time to make it happen

2010-08-20 03:03:41	lythandrel	?? portage
2010-08-20 03:03:44	@|Cadmus|	portage[1]: is the source package manager for sabayon and other gentoo based distros.  http://wiki.sabayonlinux.org/index.php?title=En:HOWTO:_The_Complete_Portage_Guide
2010-08-20 03:03:48	@|Cadmus|	portage[2]: Please keep in mind, being familiar with portage involves quite a bit more than just typing "emerge package".
2010-08-20 03:04:02	lythandrel	read teh portage guide first, oyster.  then decide if that's something you want to do.
2010-08-20 03:04:36	lythandrel	oyster: keep in mind that gentoo isn't even bringing in kde 4.5 to portage yet... it is remaining in the overlay until it's a bit more stable and complete.
2010-08-20 03:06:06	oyster	lythandrel: I don't actually=) Just wanna get tiling in kwin.
2010-08-20 03:06:23	oyster	Maybe i really shouldn't do that:D

2010-08-20 03:14:57	Radtoo	Last thing I heard was that 64 bit flash was discontinued or temporarily suspended by adobe, and that you need to use a 32bit browser with the 32bit plugin (firefox-bin... for instance) to run flash
2010-08-20 03:15:07	Radtoo	Probably nothing has changed about that yet.
2010-08-20 03:15:59	Radtoo	Releases of 64 bit flash, I should say - I don't know what they develop.
2010-08-20 03:16:10	sabayonweb_11575	Radtoo: I tried to re-install nspluginwrapper but Oper still doesn't reproduce flash on YT
2010-08-20 03:16:41	Radtoo	Might want to use the html5 variant of youtube if nothing helps, or firefox-bin
2010-08-20 03:16:51	oyster	sabayonweb_11575: have you tried 'nspluginwrapper -a -v -i'?
2010-08-20 03:17:17	Radtoo	but I'm not an opera user, I don't know if it even should work or not. :D
2010-08-20 03:17:28	Radtoo	Just that probably a 64bit of opera may not work

2010-08-20 03:53:33	iRedWar	Greetings.
2010-08-20 03:53:58	dave_64	hi
2010-08-20 03:54:06	genfool	hello iRedWar
2010-08-20 03:54:13	iRedWar	hallo
2010-08-20 03:55:48	iRedWar	Workingon virtualizing. The kernel modules with virtualbox a little bit difficult to configure.  I wanted to know if anyone here has a preffered virtualizer?
2010-08-20 03:56:01	iRedWar	I ve got virt_manager getting set to run
2010-08-20 03:56:40	dave_64	huh?  i just installed vbox a few days ago and it worked out of the box
2010-08-20 03:58:23	iRedWar	I think if I got rid of the version i have of VBOX right now, prior to the updates, I mmight now have the problems I have had.  I am able to make it work, but I have to  keep loading kernal mods every boot
2010-08-20 03:58:36	iRedWar	But just asking if anyone has a preference for Sabayon
2010-08-20 03:59:06	dave_64	add the modules to a config file....let me check which one
2010-08-20 04:00:17	dave_64	add to /etc/conf.d/modules : modules="vboxdrv vboxnetadp vboxnetflt"
2010-08-20 04:01:15	iRedWar	yeah.. Im having to mess around with that. I got it from the forum, it works but have to do it every boot up
2010-08-20 04:02:00	iRedWar	But, I am looking to try others, just for the heck of it, I just did not know if there was in particular. I already loaded up virt_manager, and I m lworking on it as we speak
2010-08-20 04:02:07	dave_64	did you add that line at the end of the file, on a line by itself?  were you root?
2010-08-20 04:02:24	iRedWar	Yes I was root, and I added it on a line on its own
2010-08-20 04:02:55	iRedWar	So not sure what I am doing wrong there, I just saw someone else had the same problem, .. the line is there.. so not sure why i Have to keep loading it in terminal
2010-08-20 04:03:03	dave_64	maybe you need to add a carriage return after adding the line
2010-08-20 04:03:04	iRedWar	But its ok, I mean, it runs great when I do it
2010-08-20 04:03:22	iRedWar	That is a good idea, I did not think about that, is that how yours looks like>
2010-08-20 04:03:23	iRedWar	?

2010-08-20 04:05:37	dave_64	all i know is that there are some config files that need a carriage return after the last line.  in fact, i messed up my install (WINXP) and installed it as root, so i didnt get around to adding anything to modules
2010-08-20 04:06:24	dave_64	my keyboard has a stuck key ...the shift key is stuck down, so i have to type with caps lock on
2010-08-20 04:06:58	iRedWar	dave_64 I am trying to mess around with WINXP x86 sp 3, but I keep getting the error, ISO not bootable.  Looked up some forums,and ppl were having problems.  I dont know if  I was in root.  But the error actually is no bootable media is found
2010-08-20 04:07:08	iRedWar	I was able to ge tFedora12 to work though
2010-08-20 04:07:10	dave_64	humidity is off the chart around here this past two months
2010-08-20 04:07:19	iRedWar	Where are you at dave?
2010-08-20 04:07:28	iRedWar	Im in FLorida, its pretty hot out here
2010-08-20 04:07:35	iRedWar	Humid  uggh
2010-08-20 04:07:41	dave_64	iowa
2010-08-20 04:07:48	iRedWar	stay cool budy
2010-08-20 04:07:57	iRedWar	Its hot and sticky out here
2010-08-20 04:08:10	genfool	dave_64,  I find that if I do not spill beer on the kb, the keys do not stick.
2010-08-20 04:08:34	dave_64	iRedWar: type    modprobe vboxdrv      before trying to install
2010-08-20 04:08:36	iRedWar	I find if I spill keys on the keyboard, that my computer runs faster
2010-08-20 04:08:57	iRedWar	dave_64 right before the install
2010-08-20 04:08:58	iRedWar	?
2010-08-20 04:09:16	iRedWar	Spill beer
2010-08-20 04:09:20	iRedWar	I just saw that
2010-08-20 04:09:21	iRedWar	doh
2010-08-20 04:09:29	dave_64	anytime after linux is booted.....yeah,  beer...heh, heh
2010-08-20 04:12:58	dave_64	are you sure your cdrom is mounted?
2010-08-20 04:13:35	iRedWar	Yeah it is.  I am working on it now, but I actually want to save this install.. and really test out virt manager have you used it yet?
2010-08-20 04:13:54	dave_64	no
2010-08-20 04:14:00	iRedWar	that command you gave me btw is what I use  when I first work it
2010-08-20 04:14:14	iRedWar	But XP ISO, checksum is good, not sure what the deal is there
2010-08-20 04:14:32	iRedWar	I also have some ISO with seven 32 bit, but that failed too initially
2010-08-20 04:14:47	iRedWar	But that was before I did the additional lines.. So as we speak I m working on adding it
2010-08-20 04:15:20	iRedWar	But I think Im going to try to use Virt_manager with 2008 Server guest and Sabayon as HOst
2010-08-20 04:16:22	iRedWar	XP Ill throw int here
2010-08-20 04:16:54	iRedWar	I noticed no how to, if I get it to work the way Im hoping, I would like to add to the forums... so I just submit it right?
2010-08-20 04:17:09	iRedWar	(virt_manager how to)
2010-08-20 04:17:21	iRedWar	Very scant what is out there
2010-08-20 04:17:23	dave_64	i don't know much about virtualization.  I just played with it a few times,  and recently installed winxp to see if i could still do it
2010-08-20 04:18:04	genfool	you could add it to the wiki, under "how to"
2010-08-20 04:19:44	iRedWar	Awesome, Im taking notes right now, so I got it on my Tomboy, and as I get through it I ll keep doing it
2010-08-20 04:19:47	iRedWar	ththen post
2010-08-20 04:20:17	iRedWar	I think this would be very useful, especially for those that are looking for alternative hypervisors
2010-08-20 04:20:24	iRedWar	or virtualizers I mena
2010-08-20 04:20:25	dave_64	yeah, i see vbox is already in the wiki howto
2010-08-20 04:20:50	iRedWar	yeah, it was very helpful, its where i got also that vbox moddrv stuff
2010-08-20 04:20:51	iRedWar	also
2010-08-20 04:21:41	iRedWar	So that was very helpful. Just slightly buggy, just not sure why I am having the hard time with the XP ISO, but I did have screwed up repos before, and it appears, that I may actually need to update  VOBX anyways
2010-08-20 04:21:45	iRedWar	VBOX
2010-08-20 04:22:10	iRedWar	Meanwhile, last night I installed virt_manager, with QEMU and working the modules part as we speak
2010-08-20 04:22:37	dave_64	is the winxp in the form of an iso?  it should be an image
2010-08-20 04:25:05	iRedWar	ISO are not images?
2010-08-20 04:25:16	iRedWar	What am I misisng?
2010-08-20 04:25:50	dave_64	if the file is of the form, winxp.iso    it is not an image....it (the .iso file) needs to be burned as an image
2010-08-20 04:26:05	iRedWar	This was burned into my CD then I moved it
2010-08-20 04:26:19	iRedWar	I used ISO BURN
2010-08-20 04:26:22	iRedWar	But ok
2010-08-20 04:26:28	dave_64	is the cd bootable
2010-08-20 04:26:38	iRedWar	Its bootable on its own yes
2010-08-20 04:27:02	dave_64	when you boot with the cd in place,  does it come up with the winxp installer?
2010-08-20 04:27:08	iRedWar	yes
2010-08-20 04:27:24	dave_64	ok, then it's an image...it should work with vbox
2010-08-20 04:27:46	iRedWar	yup that is what is throwing me for the loop there.   But... we will see
2010-08-20 04:27:55	iRedWar	I m working on it now
2010-08-20 04:28:11	dave_64	how are you starting vbox?
2010-08-20 04:29:26	iRedWar	with the modprobe
2010-08-20 04:29:39	iRedWar	It works with the other ISO's when I do that
2010-08-20 04:29:47	iRedWar	including my server 2003
2010-08-20 04:30:29	dave_64	i mean, are you starting vbox from a terminal with the command: VirtualBox
2010-08-20 04:31:37	iRedWar	I was running it form terminal before
2010-08-20 04:31:42	iRedWar	from
2010-08-20 04:31:54	iRedWar	Let me run it, I was just editing
2010-08-20 04:31:58	iRedWar	with VIM
2010-08-20 04:32:28	dave_64	and did you type: modprobe vboxdrv        at a root terminal before running VirtualBox    (at a user terminal_

2010-08-20 04:48:11	iRedWar	To make it work I usually have to do this...   for m in vbox{drv,netadp,netflt}; do modprobe $m; done
2010-08-20 04:48:36	iRedWar	Now, here is the thing.... I noticed in the equo search...   I have a lot of not installs, at least listed
2010-08-20 04:48:55	iRedWar	How about if we remove all instances of virtualbox and do another install
2010-08-20 04:49:21	iRedWar	maybe this is just a matter of what I was experiencing with some kernal issues that I just recently resovled
2010-08-20 04:49:40	dave_64	iRedWar: just run: equo remove virtualbox      then run: equo install virtualbox-bin
2010-08-20 04:51:27	iRedWar	equo remove virtual box asked about whch one... so should i just remove each one?
2010-08-20 04:51:40	iRedWar	Or remove all other the virtualbox bin
2010-08-20 04:52:19	dave_64	man,  now i'm getting confused   :)     you're call
2010-08-20 04:54:09	dave_64	all i know is my "notes"  suggest installing virtualbox-bin    and then do the other things cadmus showed you
2010-08-20 04:54:12	dave_64	?? vbox
2010-08-20 04:54:13	@|Cadmus|	vbox[1]: To configure virtualbox, after installation do the following
2010-08-20 04:54:15	@|Cadmus|	vbox[2]: modprobe vboxdrv ; modprobe vboxnetadp ; modprobe vboxnetflt
2010-08-20 04:54:17	@|Cadmus|	vbox[3]: then add the following line to the end of /etc/conf.d/modules
2010-08-20 04:54:19	@|Cadmus|	vbox[4]: modules="vboxdrv vboxnetadp vboxnetflt"
2010-08-20 04:56:19	dave_64	the first 2 items are to run vbox without rebooting...the last two items are to allow you to run vbox without loading the modules after every reboot
2010-08-20 04:56:38	iRedWar	Ok.. Im going to do it

2010-08-21 14:20:53	sabayonweb_13423	Afternoon. I was wondering if there are any recommended sizes when installing with manual partitioning? Total available space is 100 GB. Thank you.
2010-08-21 14:22:19	sabayonweb_13423	The system is a Toshiba laptop with 4 GB ram (32bit memory chip).
2010-08-21 14:25:46	sabayonweb_13423	Or should I just set / to use all of it, apart from 8 GB for the swap?
2010-08-21 14:26:57	--	sabayonweb_13423 is now known as N-S
2010-08-21 14:28:03	CaptainSifff	Well, I can report what I have for my laptop...
2010-08-21 14:28:15	CaptainSifff	but that's not necessarily recommended...
2010-08-21 14:29:32	N-S	CaptainSifff: Well, I'm just asking, so I don't set anything silly, that in the end will cause me problems.
2010-08-21 14:29:42	CaptainSifff	I have 100MB of boot partition. and ...
2010-08-21 14:30:07	CaptainSifff	I tried out lvm, so I have an lvm partition that is 105GB...
2010-08-21 14:31:19	CaptainSifff	when I find out how I partitioned it, I let you know...
2010-08-21 14:31:23	CaptainSifff	argh...
2010-08-21 14:32:44	CaptainSifff	It's about 20GB for root '/' and 80GB for home
2010-08-21 14:33:23	N-S	I'll just go for swap and /. single user on the system, so it'll be fine.
2010-08-21 14:33:29	N-S	thank you CaptainSifff
2010-08-21 14:33:56	CaptainSifff	ah and 1GB of swap
2010-08-21 14:34:06	-->	[Enrico] (~chiccoroc@gentoo/contributor/Enrico) has joined #sabayon
2010-08-21 14:34:13	CaptainSifff	with swap you should be careful on a laptop
2010-08-21 14:34:28	N-S	CaptainSifff: how come?
2010-08-21 14:34:57	CaptainSifff	the hibernate scripts can use the swap partition to store the contents of the RAM when you hibernate your system
2010-08-21 14:35:12	CaptainSifff	so you should make swap as large as you physical RAM
2010-08-21 14:35:23	N-S	yup, done
2010-08-21 14:35:47	CaptainSifff	I'll have to fix this somewhen on mine...

2010-08-21 14:58:06	sabayonweb_21594	no
2010-08-21 14:58:44	CaptainSifff	you should first do equo update

2010-08-21 15:12:52	CaptainSifff	this should be ok, I think, because you're on a new system and haven't configured anything yet.
2010-08-21 15:13:23	sabayonweb_21594	no reboot or anything
2010-08-21 15:13:32	CaptainSifff	no.

2010-08-21 19:04:34	CaptainSifff	hmm... sabayon is a rolling update distribution there's constantly something to update(ok, that's a bit of a stretch...)
2010-08-21 19:04:43	lythandrel	sabayonweb_21594: stuff on linux is done mainly through package managers..
2010-08-21 19:04:51	CaptainSifff	how far are you?

2010-08-21 19:07:08	sabayonweb_21594	i think its installing everything
2010-08-21 19:09:42	CaptainSifff	:-D
2010-08-21 19:13:00	sabayonweb_21594	yep installing 160 of 556
2010-08-21 19:13:54	CaptainSifff	will be away for a couple of hours the roadmap now is equo update then equo conf update then equo install nm-applet and then equo install ndiswrapper. After that you need that tutorial from a couple of hours ago, about setting up ndiswrapper.
2010-08-21 19:14:09	CaptainSifff	Good Luck!

2010-08-22 01:44:05	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487: if you have a spare mouse, see if the behaviour is the same.
2010-08-22 01:44:33	Azerthoth|D	rather, from your description it sounds like the first stage of a dying mouse
2010-08-22 01:44:35	sabayonweb_55487	checking...
2010-08-22 01:44:57	lythandrel	Azerthoth|D: or a change in the kernel usb handling.
2010-08-22 01:45:15	lythandrel	Azerthoth|D: or a weird driver with a power saving mode enabled.
2010-08-22 01:45:38	lythandrel	or a mouse with a powersaving mode enabled.
2010-08-22 01:45:43	lythandrel	and just odd timing.
2010-08-22 01:45:51	Azerthoth|D	USB mouse with powersave?
2010-08-22 01:47:40	sabayonweb_55487	connected spare logitech MX500 - works fine. But when I connect that doggy one to the other sabayon box (non patched for last few weeks) it work fine too.
2010-08-22 01:48:24	sabayonweb_55487	something has been injected to my system with the latest patch....

2010-08-22 01:51:50	sabayonweb_55487	sorry, it is probably my english. Lets re-frase it. Razer (that one which looks like is dying) worked fine until today (before yesterday's update) . It works fine when connected to 2nd sabayon PC, so it does not look like dying mouse
2010-08-22 01:53:18	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487: what kernel is on the other box, and what kernel is on the box where the mouse is a problem.
2010-08-22 01:54:52	sabayonweb_55487	problem one: 2.6.34-sabayon. Good one: 2.6.31-sabayon
2010-08-22 01:59:32	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487: i'm baffled on this one, and my attention span is nil today.  i'm going to ask you to submit all those pastebins to our bugtracker... bugs.sabayon.org
2010-08-22 01:59:56	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487 - including the fact that it works fine with the earlier kernel.
2010-08-22 02:00:10	sabayonweb_55487	sure I will
2010-08-22 02:00:44	lythandrel	sabayonweb_55487: you may also want to submit a copy of tht report to the manufacturer - some of them are good about linux support and may have a suggestion themselves...
2010-08-22 02:01:28	lythandrel	and overkill - but overkill is better than undereporting - kernel.orgs bugtracker and xorgs - the last one is probably unnecessary
2010-08-22 02:02:05	sabayonweb_55487	I'll give a couple tests tomorrow at work. I've got the same mouse connected to my office Sabayon box.

2010-08-22 02:18:04	BitCrypt	how come i have the directory privoxy in /etc with a new clean sl x64 K installation? the same goes for john.conf (jontheripper config file) and /var/log/tor? according to the various portage utilities these files aren't owned by any installed package? why do new systems have this cruft? am i missing something?
2010-08-22 02:20:01	Radtoo	Hm. I don't have a good overview about what files are there at install time, but possibly these are packages that get removed during install, depending on what option you choose.
2010-08-22 02:21:31	BitCrypt	the same goes for .xchat2 hidden directory inside my home directory, yet again the package isn't installed

2010-08-22 02:29:06	BitCrypt	Radtoo: well i noticed this with earlier sl versions too, i didn't bugreport is because i thought the same as you, also i can't be the first to notice this? i hate to compare with other distro's, but a clean debian install has a clean home directory withouth a leftover .fluxbox, xchat2 etc which i don't expect with a KDE install
2010-08-22 02:30:01	BitCrypt	maybe i should post it on the mailinglists because i really want to know the answer
2010-08-22 02:30:08	Radtoo	I can't know that. Maybe hundreds noticed it but no one was bothered by it. :)
2010-08-22 02:31:16	BitCrypt	well the developers should have noticed it and be bothered by it from QA standpoint
2010-08-22 02:31:41	BitCrypt	it's unacceptable IMO, but maybe i'm totaly wrong here
2010-08-22 02:32:27	Radtoo	As for the .fluxbox etc, they are not leftovers. check /etc/skel/ ...
2010-08-22 02:32:55	Radtoo	That's the proposed default user dir layout. You sure can report if you don't like something about it, but its intentional
2010-08-22 02:33:10	BitCrypt	Radtoo: i choose KDE, not .fluxbox, .fluxbox has no reason to be in the skeleton scripts anyway if I choose KDE
2010-08-22 02:33:37	Radtoo	It does. Sabayon's theming and so on is there.
2010-08-22 02:34:53	Radtoo	If you don't like it, delete it...

2010-08-22 02:35:46	BitCrypt	so what is .xchat2 doeing in my home directory? it has obviously nothing todo with theming, and i didn't install .xchat
2010-08-22 02:36:07	BitCrypt	Radtoo: you don't get the point, if these simple things are overlooked, why would i trust the developers of this distro anyway?
2010-08-22 02:36:35	Radtoo	Sure it does. Default usernames and server settings to make the "get live help now" link work and stuff, I bet.
2010-08-22 02:36:44	BitCrypt	Radtoo: install debian with X DE and you won't find all this cruft laying around
2010-08-22 02:37:22	BitCrypt	or funtoo
2010-08-22 02:37:24	Radtoo	And?
2010-08-22 02:37:27	BitCrypt	or vanilla gentoo etc etc
2010-08-22 02:37:48	Radtoo	Sabayon is neither of them, kind of the point here.
2010-08-22 02:38:00	Radtoo	Some choices are different, otherwise you'd not need a different distro.
2010-08-22 02:38:46	BitCrypt	no it's gentoo testing with an overlay, but i guess nobody cares if system is a mess, every file should be accountable by the package manager
2010-08-22 02:39:01	BitCrypt	except for log files, tmp and no what
2010-08-22 02:39:13	Radtoo	no, even in gentoo there's a hands-off policy for /etc and default files in /etc/skel/ ...
2010-08-22 02:39:25	sabayonuser2	I am having a problem, my sound is really low and my alsamixer only shows the Master, I know there is normally Master and Front, and that is normally the problem on other OS'es, is there a way to access all of the levels?
2010-08-22 02:39:44	Radtoo	But you don't need to like that, I don't really care. I just tell you, it's intentional and I can also tell you, no one other than you got upset about it so far... or had problems with it.
2010-08-22 02:39:48	BitCrypt	Radtoo: if i extract a stage tarball it doesn't contain jontheripper or privoxy by defaul
2010-08-22 02:39:52	Radtoo	None that I saw here.
2010-08-22 02:40:02	Radtoo	Sure it doesn't, but if you install and then uninstall it again...
2010-08-22 02:40:13	Radtoo	 /etc gets left over.
2010-08-22 02:40:20	BitCrypt	Radtoo: yes than i can understand it, but now i'm not sure
2010-08-22 02:41:28	Radtoo	sabayonuser2: hm, maybe alsamixer -c1 or -c2 or such? (multiple sound cards / virtual sound cards?)
2010-08-22 02:42:27	sabayonuser2	Radtoo: Thank you for pointing me in the right direction. I got it.
2010-08-22 02:42:49	Radtoo	sabayonuser2: nice. :)
2010-08-22 02:43:05	BitCrypt	Radtoo: and why do you think it's not intentional?
2010-08-22 02:44:56	BitCrypt	Radtoo: so i install 5.3 and the installation image contains tor and privoxy and the uninstalls them after the first equo update? so the install image is wrong?
2010-08-22 02:44:58	Radtoo	BitCrypt: Did I say such a thing? I actually think I mostly said things were intentional additions or a consequence of how things are done on Gentoo.
2010-08-22 02:45:22	Radtoo	BitCrypt: Actually, I think it even uninstalls things during install. I think it deploys a snapshot first, then removes undesired packages...
2010-08-22 02:46:29	BitCrypt	Radtoo: it shouldn't be in the initial snapshot then, or is there a general snapshots with gets modified during install for a K, G install?
2010-08-22 02:46:52	BitCrypt	err, which
2010-08-22 02:47:03	Radtoo	BitCrypt: K/G are different but I think there is a general snapshot for the different install target and it gets modified.
2010-08-22 02:47:43	BitCrypt	Radtoo: ok

2010-08-22 07:24:01	@|Cadmus|	wicd: First, make sure wicd is installed, then as root perform the following: 'rc-update add wicd default ; rc-update del NetworkManager ; /etc/init.d/NetworkManager stop ; /etc/init.d/wicd start' then as normal user you can start wicd-client to connect. It is recommended to add wicd-client to autostart as handled by your desktop environment

2010-08-22 11:55:56	inaeth	sabayonweb_68659: Onboard nVidia chipsets should already be detected by the kernel. What is the resolution and alpha masking that it's loading your X session at?
2010-08-22 11:56:48	Radtoo	sabayonweb_11401: apparently not... anyhow, it appears this uses ffmpeg. Its not in sabayon's package manager, though. May I suggest to use avidemux or some other alternative that is in sabayon's package manager, or using ffmpeg from the command line?
2010-08-22 11:57:24	Radtoo	The latter isn't actually hard if you use ffmpeg preset files (.ffpreset, there's some floating around on the 'net and ffmpeg ships with x264 ones)

2010-08-22 11:59:22	sabayonweb_11401	im not familiar with ffmpeg... does ffmpeg already installd on our system by default or we need to install it?
2010-08-22 11:59:50	Radtoo	I am not sure. Might already be installed... a lot of applications use it. But it's a command line tool.
2010-08-22 12:00:26	inaeth	sabayonweb_68659: Um.... that xorg is really messed up. You didn't specify a video driver to load, so X is resorting to the default VGA drivers.
2010-08-22 12:01:21	Radtoo	Quite easy to use with presets, though. "ffmpeg -vcodec libx264 -vpre normal -i <input file> -o <output file>"... change the preset and the encoding settings change. Even so, you might not need to use it at all, avidemux is very powerful
2010-08-22 12:03:38	sabayonweb_68659	hmm... driver "nv" isnt correct? or how i specify the driver?

2010-08-22 21:39:56	genfool	glide,  did you actually do the update? I got .33 and .35 in my update today...2 for the price of 1
2010-08-22 21:40:00	glide	dyingmuppet: why isn't my build picking up 2.6.35?  any ideas?
2010-08-22 21:40:09	glide	my other sabayon machine has it
2010-08-22 21:40:28	dyingmuppet	hmm, I haven't noticed that though
2010-08-22 21:40:52	dyingmuppet	one sec, and I'll check it for myself
2010-08-22 21:42:53	tyr12	picking up?
2010-08-22 21:43:00	glide	i'm not getting 2.6.35 in a new slot.  eselect kernel list only shows 2.6.34
2010-08-22 21:43:04	tyr12	i actually have to type 'equo install linux-sabayon' for it to show up
2010-08-22 21:43:05	tyr12	ahh
2010-08-22 21:43:51	tyr12	with the exception of eselect defaulting to xorg during the most recent batch of updates, its always worked fine for me - hence, no knowledge of how to troubleshoot it.

2010-08-22 21:45:50	 *	tyr12 nods at dyingmuppet
2010-08-22 21:46:29	tyr12	what i really want to know, and what i really haven't bothered troubleshooting, is why my work laptop wireless card is not seen by iwconfig/ifconfig (but is by lspci) - its officially supported by 34 and 35 (=
2010-08-22 21:46:40	tyr12	but again, i haven't bothered troubleshooting, so don't help.
2010-08-22 21:46:45	dyingmuppet	glide: though, its safe to install the .35 kernel you have to be sure to update the dependend packages too
2010-08-22 21:47:06	glide	so equo query revdeps linux-sabayon?
2010-08-22 21:47:07	dyingmuppet	tyr12: maybe a faulty/buggy driver?
2010-08-22 21:47:53	dyingmuppet	glide: well, I've never used it that way, I used the hard part and equo search #2.6.35 to get al installed packages with a 2.6.35 tag
2010-08-22 21:48:04	tyr12	dyingmuppet: don't have to install a package, actually, for that card.  i tried.
2010-08-22 21:48:13	tyr12	and downloaded firmware, etc.
2010-08-22 21:48:59	dyingmuppet	than it could be possible to be a faulty driver, although its included in the kernel
2010-08-22 21:49:20	tyr12	id boot into linux on it and test, but i have to do work right now, and thats on the windows half stilll
2010-08-22 21:49:27	glide	well, i know my superio driver borks on loading
2010-08-22 21:50:01	dyingmuppet	tyr12: no problem, there's plenty of time later... hopefully xD
2010-08-22 21:50:19	glide	looks like nvidia driver problems
2010-08-22 21:50:31	tyr12	eselect opengl list ?
2010-08-22 21:50:38	glide	i just reinstalled nvidia drivers, and i see it doing stuff with 2.6.35-sabayon
2010-08-22 21:50:41	tyr12	as mine was defaulted to xorg after the recent updates
2010-08-22 21:51:54	glide	tyr12: was set to xorg-x11
2010-08-22 21:52:05	glide	strange, nvidia drivers pulled in 2.6.35
2010-08-22 21:52:07	tyr12	glide: yep.  for me, it shouldn't've been.
2010-08-22 21:52:30	dyingmuppet	glide, thats because eselect automatically selects the last installed kernel
2010-08-22 21:52:47	glide	now i see 2.6.35 in eselect kernel list

2010-08-22 22:02:18	tyr12	im running 2.6.35, using nvidia-drivers slotted for 2.6.35.  equo upgrade --pretend wants to pull nvidia-drivers and linux-sabayon for 2.6.32

2010-08-22 22:48:59	Sublime`	no, 32
2010-08-22 22:49:39	lxnay	exec format error clearly denotes something related to weird with your hook (inner_chroot_script or whatever) executable
2010-08-22 22:49:43	lxnay	fix it
2010-08-22 22:50:26	Sublime`	mkay, running again with prechroot
2010-08-22 22:50:36	lxnay	exec format error (error 8) is usually generated when you're running an executable on an unsupported architecture
2010-08-22 22:51:40	lxnay	or your script shebang is wrong
2010-08-22 22:52:04	lxnay	definitely not a bug in our software

2010-08-22 22:59:16	Diddlebug	Hey all.
2010-08-22 22:59:46	Diddlebug	Question: What is the most expedient way to backup my system? I finally have everything working just right (famous last words, I know)...
2010-08-22 23:00:07	Sublime`	Diddlebug: tar
2010-08-22 23:00:09	Diddlebug	Is there an equivalent of "ghosting" as there is with Windows?
2010-08-22 23:00:14	DHalens	luckybackup ?
2010-08-22 23:00:34	DHalens	luckybackup uses rsync to copy data iirc
2010-08-22 23:01:21	Diddlebug	Does the backup require the exact amount of diskpace currently allotted? That is, I have a system installed on a 200GB harddrive, with 6GB Swap, 55GB System, and remaining GB in Home
2010-08-22 23:01:35	Diddlebug	Luckybackup, gmm.
2010-08-22 23:01:36	Sublime`	Diddlebug: no
2010-08-22 23:01:56	Sublime`	not if you tar
2010-08-22 23:02:10	Diddlebug	How do I tar? with LuckyBackup?
2010-08-22 23:02:25	Diddlebug	Is there a GUI that uses Tar compression?
2010-08-22 23:02:44	Diddlebug	or rather, for use with tar compression, i mean.
2010-08-22 23:02:47	DHalens	with a simple system like the ones we propose, actually you're doing something like copy and paste. If you mess partitions, you won't be able to restore them
2010-08-22 23:03:09	Diddlebug	When you say "mess" partitions, what do you mean?
2010-08-22 23:03:29	Diddlebug	How do you guys back up your system?
2010-08-22 23:03:35	Sublime`	don't
2010-08-22 23:03:40	DHalens	we don't :P
2010-08-22 23:03:51	Diddlebug	ha, really?
2010-08-22 23:04:06	DHalens	i mean like if your hard drive breaks or something like that
2010-08-22 23:04:27	Sublime`	DHalens: i only backup pictures, movies, and music on an external hdd
2010-08-22 23:04:29	Sublime`	that's all
2010-08-22 23:04:35	Diddlebug	So you are saying, there is no actual way to make an image of a system to reimage?
2010-08-22 23:04:57	Diddlebug	Ie, I bought a new harddrive and wanted to simply deploy my old system on the new drive.
2010-08-22 23:05:03	Sublime`	there is
2010-08-22 23:05:06	Sublime`	but cba
2010-08-22 23:05:12	Diddlebug	CBA?

2010-08-22 23:05:27	DHalens	of course there is, but think that at the same time you copy a whole partition, system is writing data on them... in other words, you can't backup while running your system
2010-08-22 23:05:28	Sublime`	it's easier/better to just reinstall
2010-08-22 23:06:01	Sublime`	also Diddlebug look into RAID 1
2010-08-22 23:06:14	Diddlebug	Yeah, I thought about RAID mirroring.
2010-08-22 23:06:28	Diddlebug	DHalens, I'm surprised this can't be done.
2010-08-22 23:06:53	Sublime`	this can be done, we dont see a reason
2010-08-22 23:06:57	DHalens	well, i've heard btrfs can do things like that....
2010-08-22 23:07:07	Diddlebug	For enterprise deployment as an example
2010-08-22 23:07:47	dyingmuppet	then you can also make a spinoff with the software you need, and make an iso to install on all of the systems
2010-08-22 23:08:01	Diddlebug	Good point.
2010-08-22 23:08:01	Sublime`	yeah, what im trying to do
2010-08-22 23:08:08	Sublime`	i'll let you know if it works >:(
2010-08-22 23:08:17	Diddlebug	I guess that's the next step in my Linux Journey.
2010-08-22 23:08:27	Diddlebug	I just started using Linux a little over a month ago.

2010-08-22 23:09:32	Sublime`	lol....
2010-08-22 23:09:38	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: then I guess its better to first play a little and don't get too much important data on there :P
2010-08-22 23:09:47	Diddlebug	Very true!
2010-08-22 23:09:51	Sublime`	lxnay, dyingmuppet: seems to be working, but it's not done yet so don't quote me on that
2010-08-22 23:09:53	dyingmuppet	maybe some external drive or something
2010-08-22 23:09:57	Diddlebug	But I've already realized that I stopped using Windows
2010-08-22 23:10:15	 *	dyingmuppet holds its fingers crossed *
2010-08-22 23:10:15	Diddlebug	I booted to Windows and there were 8 trillion updates and such, and it made me realize how long its been since i booted to it.
2010-08-22 23:10:30	dyingmuppet	ghehe
2010-08-22 23:10:34	Diddlebug	By the way, why was there an update to reinstall the 2.5.34 kernal?
2010-08-22 23:10:39	Diddlebug	I'm sorry, 2.6.34?
2010-08-22 23:10:42	Sublime`	i get more updates with sabayon than windows so....
2010-08-22 23:11:02	Diddlebug	Sublime, for sure, but they aren't "critical error" bugs
2010-08-22 23:11:02	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: because there was a patch build for the kernel to fix some bugs
2010-08-22 23:11:13	Diddlebug	haha, nice timing
2010-08-22 23:11:24	dyingmuppet	and they aren't as big as M$ updates

2010-08-23 00:18:03	Diddlebug	There's some peculiar price issue with RAM though. 2GB modules are cheap while 4GB modules are obscenely expensive.

2010-08-23 00:25:10	dyingmuppet	also virtualbox will show you a bar from green to red that indicates the amount thats save to use

2010-08-23 00:27:24	Diddlebug	or is Linux efficient in how it uses mem?
2010-08-23 00:28:09	dyingmuppet	Linux in itself is pretty efficient in useing its memory, in most cases it caches up all the ram to have faster access to it
2010-08-23 00:29:05	dyingmuppet	swap, nowadays, isn't really needed anymore, but it's always good to have some to be sure

2010-08-23 00:35:44	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: for the size of a swap drive, in the early days the said to at least a double amount of the memory you have installed, nowadays 2GB is more than enough
2010-08-23 00:37:44	Diddlebug	Sublime, that's a shame - guilt breeds humility.
2010-08-23 00:38:10	Diddlebug	dyingmuppet - can I alter swap size after installation?
2010-08-23 00:38:12	Radtoo	Diddlebug: I often do 0 swap on installations with more RAM. Linux may be clever in guessing what to put in swap, usually, but there's just not an aweful lot even it can do about RAM being in the order of 1000x+ faster than a classic hdd
2010-08-23 00:38:34	Diddlebug	Ahh...

2010-08-23 01:01:16	dyingmuppet	you first have to turn it off before you can use a diskmanager to resize the swap drive

2010-08-23 01:06:32	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: same here
2010-08-23 01:06:33	Diddlebug	Can anyone explain why my driver install looks like this? http://imgur.com/XqZ0h.png
2010-08-23 01:06:51	Sublime`	no offense to the developers, but can you explain why you're using sulfur?
2010-08-23 01:06:53	Sublime`	lol
2010-08-23 01:06:54	dyingmuppet	Sublime`: hmm, i'm not sure, is it still a chroot like situation thats been build to a iso?
2010-08-23 01:07:02	Sublime`	well, it built the ISO
2010-08-23 01:07:22	Sublime`	but I want to customize it a little more than it already is, like edit the grub, disable xdm on boot, etc
2010-08-23 01:07:40	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: because older versiones will be removed and nvidia-drivers-195.36.31 will be installed
2010-08-23 01:07:55	Diddlebug	But even after updating, it remains like this
2010-08-23 01:08:01	Diddlebug	That's the issue.
2010-08-23 01:08:08	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: maybe you selected it that way?
2010-08-23 01:08:15	Diddlebug	It says everything is up to date, but it never looks fully installed.
2010-08-23 01:08:37	Diddlebug	I actually tried to select to reinstall the driver, and after reinstallation, this is how it looks in Entroy.

2010-08-23 01:26:49	marcusironfist	diddlebug, the hd died hard a few months ago...  been stuck with live cd/dvd's for a while...
2010-08-23 01:27:07	dyingmuppet	Diddlebug: mount
2010-08-23 01:27:24	dyingmuppet	if i'm right
2010-08-23 01:27:44	Diddlebug	marcus...wow. HDs are cheap, have you considered getting one? I know that doesn't answer the issue
2010-08-23 01:28:16	marcusironfist	umm, yeah, i've looked...  the lt is a few years old, and uses ide...  every store i know sells only SATA...
2010-08-23 01:28:21	Diddlebug	yup, no swap shown
2010-08-23 01:28:27	Diddlebug	how can I make this permant?
2010-08-23 01:28:45	marcusironfist	take the swap entry out of /etc/fstab
2010-08-23 01:29:01	Diddlebug	I have the system set up on an LVM inside the 200gb HD
2010-08-23 01:29:03	dyingmuppet	exactly
2010-08-23 01:29:30	marcusironfist	lol, i'm no linux n00b, but sometimes there are still things that catch me off-guard...
2010-08-23 01:29:55	dyingmuppet	yeah, LVM is one of the parts I didn't really messed with yet...
2010-08-23 01:30:28	marcusironfist	doesn't matter if you use lvm or not, diddlebug, just take the swap entry out of the fstab file, then you can reformat that partition for a usable fs...
2010-08-23 01:30:29	Diddlebug	Okay, I deleted the line. God I hope I didn't kill my system
2010-08-23 01:30:46	marcusironfist	is the swap inside or outside the lvm?
2010-08-23 01:30:49	Diddlebug	got it, thanks marcus
2010-08-23 01:30:50	Diddlebug	inside
2010-08-23 01:30:57	marcusironfist	lol
2010-08-23 01:31:08	Diddlebug	why is that a stupid newb mistake?
2010-08-23 01:31:11	marcusironfist	when i've done lvm on a few machines, i ALWAYS keep swap outside lvm
2010-08-23 01:31:29	Diddlebug	When I installed Sabayon, I didn't know my a** from my elbow
2010-08-23 01:31:37	Sublime`	why does cp take up so much memory
2010-08-23 01:31:37	Diddlebug	I've only been using for a month or so...
2010-08-23 01:31:40	dyingmuppet	thats more of a user prefereability
2010-08-23 01:31:51	dyingmuppet	minus last e
2010-08-23 01:32:07	Diddlebug	I realize that it might have made more sense to install /home on a separate partition too.
2010-08-23 01:32:08	marcusironfist	i make a 50mb for /boot as partition 1, 500mb-1gb for swap as partition 2, then the rest of the space on all involved drives for the lvm
2010-08-23 01:32:30	dyingmuppet	Sublime`: cp is caching it first into ram before moving it for real
2010-08-23 01:32:33	Diddlebug	I kept it inside LVM because I wanted the entire thing encrypted
2010-08-23 01:32:39	Sublime`	that's so gay
2010-08-23 01:32:44	Sublime`	froze my whole system
2010-08-23 01:32:47	Azerthoth	it doesnt need to be in an LVM to be encrypted
2010-08-23 01:32:53	dyingmuppet	well, at least caching it not really on ram probably
2010-08-23 01:33:02	Diddlebug	but wouldn't I have to input an extra key at boot?
2010-08-23 01:33:20	dyingmuppet	brb, smoke
2010-08-23 01:33:20	marcusironfist	umm, dude, swap is nearly impossible to read unless you know the swap functions of the kernel intimately...
2010-08-23 01:33:34	Azerthoth	encrypted or unencrypted, it only takes passphrase once
2010-08-23 01:33:53	Diddlebug	Like I said, I didn't (and apparently still don't) know my a$$ from my elbow about these things.
2010-08-23 01:33:55	marcusironfist	and a swap partition doesn't store data like a regular one does
2010-08-23 01:34:16	Diddlebug	I always thought a swap was the vulnerability in a system
2010-08-23 01:34:22	marcusironfist	can you read the contents of the windows swap file?
2010-08-23 01:34:27	Diddlebug	I think so.
2010-08-23 01:34:31	Azerthoth	LVM just adds a layer of complexity, and honestly most people dont use it properly anyway
2010-08-23 01:34:42	Diddlebug	I think that's why there were programs to scrub the swap file
2010-08-23 01:34:43	marcusironfist	not in a human-readable way you can't
2010-08-23 01:34:52	Diddlebug	that's good to know.
2010-08-23 01:35:02	Diddlebug	What's the proper way to use LVM?
2010-08-23 01:35:11	marcusironfist	linux is 10000 times more secure than windows could ever dream of being
2010-08-23 01:35:15	Sublime`	Diddlebug: you're just full of dreams aren't you
2010-08-23 01:35:17	Diddlebug	I just saw it as equivalent to logical partitions in windows
2010-08-23 01:35:22	Sublime`	i think you and google would seriously be best friends
2010-08-23 01:35:30	Diddlebug	of dreams?
2010-08-23 01:35:38	Azerthoth	use of LVM is so that you can seamlessly add more room from other drives to make it appear that a partition is larger
2010-08-23 01:35:50	marcusironfist	exactly, Az
2010-08-23 01:36:02	Diddlebug	You mean have a volume run across mutliple physical drives
2010-08-23 01:36:08	marcusironfist	diddlebug, lvm is only effective on a machine with more than one drive
2010-08-23 01:36:08	Azerthoth	correct
2010-08-23 01:36:29	Diddlebug	Why then does Sabayon's default setup arrange the installation with an LVM setup?
2010-08-23 01:36:30	marcusironfist	if you only have one drive in the machine, lvm adds unneccessary overhead
2010-08-23 01:36:34	Diddlebug	even on a clean drive?
2010-08-23 01:36:39	Azerthoth	and it has a downside, if one drive or one partition dies, the whole thing dies, all of it

2010-08-23 01:37:41	Diddlebug	Again, why does Sabayon default to this even when installing on a single drive?
2010-08-23 01:37:57	Azerthoth	side effect of anaconda
2010-08-23 01:38:18	Diddlebug	Is there enough of a performance hit that it would be worth it for me to reinstall without LVM?

2010-08-23 01:52:33	Sublime`	wat is this orb thing
2010-08-23 01:52:53	Azerthoth	all LVM does on a single disc system is add a few steps if you have to get in and chroot into it
2010-08-23 01:53:11	Diddlebug	Another dream...
2010-08-23 01:53:22	Diddlebug	Can I ask: What type of encryption does the LUKS system use?
2010-08-23 01:53:22	Azerthoth	happily I wrote a script that handles that for you
2010-08-23 01:53:51	Azerthoth	dm-crypt, defaults to aes256
2010-08-23 01:53:52	Diddlebug	I saw that....how to automunt
2010-08-23 01:53:52	Diddlebug	its in the forums as a sticky, right?
2010-08-23 01:53:52	Azerthoth	yup

2010-08-23 01:53:55	Azerthoth	in the wiki there is a manual way too
2010-08-23 01:53:56	Diddlebug	I'll use your script, thanks :)
2010-08-23 02:12:47	marcusironfist	is there a way to make a live cd/dvd load files from a usb device during boot?  like maybe using the usb device as the /home?
2010-08-23 02:15:01	Diddlebug	Its pretty impressive that things like LUKS and on-the-fly decryption exist. I was watching a documentary on the the decryption of the german Enigma machines back in WWII
2010-08-23 02:24:05	Diddlebug	Brilliant stuff on all sides.

2010-08-23 02:24:54	Diddlebug	does the bios not support it?

2010-09-06 10:42:01	quesada	that's what I do
2010-09-06 10:42:24	quesada	then logging in is an extra step, plus loading the entire desktop... nvidia settings bypasses that
2010-09-06 10:42:37	@wolfden	does runnning nvidia-settings at terminal pull anything?
2010-09-06 10:42:44	quesada	nope
2010-09-06 10:42:55	@wolfden	don't sound fix to me than
2010-09-06 10:43:03	quesada	whereis returns nothing
2010-09-06 10:43:06	quesada	yeah
2010-09-06 10:43:19	@wolfden	if bug closed, reopen
2010-09-06 10:43:39	quesada	will do thanks
2010-09-06 10:43:57	@wolfden	I have always found with nv-settings, it can never get the 2nd monitor res correct
2010-09-06 10:44:23	quesada	works ok here (on the other 3 machines, before the change upstream)
2010-09-06 10:44:55	@wolfden	detects it, but it never gets teh corrct res like 1600x1200
2010-09-06 10:45:08	@wolfden	maybe 1024 at the max
2010-09-06 10:45:38	@wolfden	editing file vs fighting a gui ftw
2010-09-06 10:46:43	@wolfden	than I use nvclock with conky to monitor it :-)

2010-09-06 17:07:35	genfool	in my experience, sabayon is a bit bleeding edge, making it compatible with most newer hardware...has worked for me where others do not.
2010-09-06 17:09:11	PaddyMac	The problem I've really had with Sabayon is installing. Once it's installed it works great.

2010-09-06 17:17:09	thomasfuston	no button works except the first button, aaand if i click the first button the mouse on the desktop freeze till i put the pen away from tablet and again on it, so its only half workin (bah this tablet fail is so stupid to explain) :P
2010-09-06 17:17:53	thomasfuston	xsetwacom dont helps either :P
2010-09-06 17:18:14	glide	so you've been thru that wiki and it's links?

2010-09-06 17:19:18	PaddyMac	thomasfuston: I got my wacom tablet working, and I was able to get one other user to get his working. Maybe I can help you get yours working.
2010-09-06 17:19:38	glide	you looked at the ubuntu and arch links?  their documentation is usually very thorough
2010-09-06 17:19:41	thomasfuston	glide: ia musing the newest xf86-input-wacom thing so i dont need the linux-wacom stuff
2010-09-06 17:20:14	thomasfuston	ubuntu tells only about linux-wacom driver
2010-09-06 17:20:49	Radtoo	And gentoo has separate modules for xorg and in-kernel support...

2010-09-06 17:21:17	thomasfuston	PaddyMac: well i got an Wacom Bamboo mte-450, the problem is it gets detected out of the box, but no button works except the first button (when you touch the pen on the pad)
2010-09-06 17:21:22	PaddyMac	There are multiple issues going on with the wacom tablets. The first and foremost is that - especially for the newer tablets - the wacom kernel driver doesn't suport them, so you do have do download teh linuxwacom package and compile the kernel module from source even if you're using the xf86-input-wacom driver.
2010-09-06 17:21:39	PaddyMac	Hmm.... Are you using HAL or UDEV?
2010-09-06 17:22:12	glide	sourcforge has 10.8.1, but i see 10.6 in equo, perhaps it will be fixed soon
2010-09-06 17:22:34	thomasfuston	PaddyMac: here comes the real problem, if i touch the pad with the pen, the mous on the desktop get freeze, and i cant move it around anymore, only if i scratch the pen over the pad like if i painting anything,
2010-09-06 17:22:47	thomasfuston	PaddyMac: hopefully this description was precice enough
2010-09-06 17:23:00	thomasfuston	PaddyMac: thats a good question i guess HAL, but i am not 100% sure
2010-09-06 17:23:10	PaddyMac	I am using xorg-server 1.9, and even though I have it compiled to use udev, teh xf86-input-wacom driver still only uses HAL, so have you installed the hal rules file for teh wacom tablet?
2010-09-06 17:23:56	PaddyMac	Because mypen worked with just the udev rules installed, but the touch didn't work until I also installed teh hal rules.

2010-09-06 17:25:27	PaddyMac	As long as you're using xorg-1.7 or higher it should be the same.

2010-09-06 17:26:48	thomasfuston	well i will try it on weekend when enough time, but thx so far for some help
2010-09-06 17:27:15	glide	changelog for 10.8 has lots of fixes in it
2010-09-06 17:27:19	PaddyMac	You might not have to compile the kernel module since your tablet is already detected, but yes I had to compile the kernel module from teh linuxwacom package because the kernel module included in the currect linux kernel did not yet support my tablet, but the one in the linuxwacom package does.

2010-09-06 17:30:06	PaddyMac	But mine is the CTH-460 is I remember right.
2010-09-06 17:30:08	thomasfuston	well there is no conflict, just tablet > mouse
2010-09-06 17:30:56	PaddyMac	Ubuntu might only talk about Linuxwacom if they're still using an xorg version under 1.7
2010-09-06 17:31:57	PaddyMac	You could try downgrading to xorg-server 1.6.5, but that might create as many problems as it solves depending on your setup.
2010-09-06 17:35:26	_genfool	dang the installer hates this box  :(
2010-09-06 17:36:01	glide	there are some testing ebuilds for 10.8, perhaps you can find it
2010-09-06 17:36:25	PaddyMac	It hated my laptop too, but 5.3 semed noticeably faster than 5.2 for some reason once it was up and running.

2010-09-06 21:08:31	Radtoo	Harm_: If you want to say that, its not quite incorrect :p

2010-09-06 21:09:48	arkanabar	yes.  I was sure I'd tried that, but it worked this time.
2010-09-06 21:09:55	Radtoo	Harm_: It also may appeal to a bunch of people that entirely want to run gentoo but want to start with some convenience :D
2010-09-06 21:10:08	Radtoo	arkanabar: happens
2010-09-06 21:10:09	Harm_	that's how i ended up with sabayon, heh
2010-09-06 21:10:25	Harm_	oh.. but photoshop doesn't work with wine anymore :p
2010-09-06 21:10:55	barto09	hi, i'm "new" to linux and wanted to try sabayon, is what this guide tells correct? (http://www.ehow.com/how_6071556_dual-boot-sabayon-linux.html), I mean, is it possible to install Sabayon inside windows? (like a program)
2010-09-06 21:11:12	Radtoo	Harm_: Note, convenience is rather limited if you change your CFLAGS or USE-FLAGS or can't really deal with portage very well, 'cause 1000+ packages will give you some corresponding amount of work on an update :p
2010-09-06 21:11:21	Radtoo	barto09: almost, yes.
2010-09-06 21:11:30	Harm_	i like a challenge :p
2010-09-06 21:11:31	Radtoo	barto09: the easiest way would be to use virtualbox, vmware, or antoher virtualization program
2010-09-06 21:11:48	Harm_	as long as it doesn't involve some basic features, like ati drivers.. :)
2010-09-06 21:12:09	Radtoo	barto09: Its also the safest way... but of course its not entirely the same in terms of performance (like, virtualbox can't entirely use your 3d hardware, its already occupied by windows - etc)
2010-09-06 21:12:50	arkanabar	barto09: wubi is supposed to be both safe and stupid easy, but that's ubuntu and I wouldn't blame you for wanting to avoid that.
2010-09-06 21:12:55	Radtoo	Harm_: using it with portage includes more challenges than just that.
2010-09-06 21:13:15	Radtoo	barto09: I'll definitely suggest AGAINST using wubi even with ubuntu. Virtualizing is safer.
2010-09-06 21:13:30	barto09	yes, in the past i used to have ubuntu installed "as a program"  via wubi

2010-09-06 21:15:29	Harm_	i thought sabayon had automagically installed ati drivers?

2010-09-06 21:20:30	Radtoo	laci: maybe also try btrfs and compression

2010-09-06 21:33:27	arkanabar	there is one thing Warren Woodford does with MEPIS I wish was more widely adopted -- allowing you to blacklist modules that you don't have the hardware for.  Bluetooth, for example.
2010-09-06 21:33:41	Radtoo	uh, well, gentoo's initrd allows you to
2010-09-06 21:33:53	Radtoo	which is also sabayon's initrd... and it long did
2010-09-06 21:34:18	Radtoo	of course you can also recompile your kernel to not include the modules, but that's something you can do everywhere...
2010-09-06 21:35:11	arkanabar	I'll have to read up on that, cos I am largely a non-technical user.
2010-09-06 21:35:35	arkanabar	but that does seem to be one of the things that's pretty obscure in buntuland.

2010-09-06 23:02:34	Radtoo	But that's a solution that destroys folder hierarchies and sometimes file names and stuff - a last ditch solution. Also it requires another drive to write on.

2010-09-07 00:02:50	Diddlebug	I wouldn't think so...Why would gentoo be any harder?

2010-09-07 00:02:58	Diddlebug	why?
2010-09-07 00:03:02	Azerthoth	sabayonweb_74425, writes arent an issue with modern SSD's
2010-09-07 00:03:24	Azerthoth	mean time before failure if you do the math is minimum of 50 years
2010-09-07 00:03:27	sabayonweb_74425	because it is source based, doesnt it compile quite a bit (less than gentoo though)

2010-09-07 01:40:04	Azerthoth	there arent any iso.1 .2 .3 files, those would be generated by your download manager
2010-09-07 01:40:06	Shawn_	Is 1.66GB the correct size
2010-09-07 01:40:08	Azerthoth	~2 gig
2010-09-07 01:40:16	Shawn_	Does 1.66GB sound right
2010-09-07 01:40:31	Shawn_	Im thinking it was because I redownloaded 3 times c ause it kept failing

2010-09-07 01:41:08	Shawn_	Yeah 1.6GB is the correct size
2010-09-07 01:41:15	Shawn_	It must just be ebcause of the failed downloads
2010-09-07 01:41:17	Azerthoth	Shawn_, those .1 .2 etc files are your restarts

2010-09-07 01:41:35	Shawn_	Cause the last one I did is the one that finished

2010-09-07 01:47:43	Shawn_	To match them
2010-09-07 01:47:55	Azerthoth	read the link I gave you
2010-09-07 01:47:58	Azerthoth	?? md5

2010-09-07 01:48:42	Shawn_	I have it
2010-09-07 01:48:52	Shawn_	Now how do I read the .md5 file
2010-09-07 01:48:53	sabayabadu	Azerthoth: how to i aunch rfkill? I installed it, but "rfkill" is an iinvalid command
2010-09-07 01:48:54	Shawn_	To compare it
2010-09-07 01:49:26	sabayabadu	Azerthoth: and sorry for my noobism
2010-09-07 01:50:09	Azerthoth	Shawn_, literacy, its whats for breakfast, from link "md5sum /path/to/file.iso "
2010-09-07 01:50:26	Shawn_	Do i do that for the .md5 too is what Im asking,,
2010-09-07 01:50:27	Azerthoth	Shawn_, then cat the .md5 and compare
2010-09-07 01:50:42	Azerthoth	sabayabadu, you'll have to install it
2010-09-07 01:50:46	Shawn_	It never says to cat the .md5
2010-09-07 01:51:01	sabayabadu	Azerthoth: I did
2010-09-07 01:51:04	sabayonweb_52792	That I can do?
2010-09-07 01:51:22	Shawn_	Azerthoth, Okay problem... The md5sums dont match at all but I just booted from the supposedly incorrect file
2010-09-07 01:51:35	Shawn_	And its working fine
2010-09-07 01:51:45	sabayabadu	equo install rfkill, right? installed one package
2010-09-07 01:52:04	Azerthoth	Shawn_, md5 dont match you have a corrupt download, it may work but fail at some other point
2010-09-07 01:52:15	Azerthoth	say after you repartition
2010-09-07 01:52:21	Shawn_	I dont see how it corrupted...
2010-09-07 01:52:28	Shawn_	It finished downloading just fine
2010-09-07 01:52:52	Shawn_	This is the third time Ive had to install sabayon because of supposedly correupted files that someone else checked for me
2010-09-07 01:53:02	Azerthoth	Shawn_, that does not require an answer, if you cant see the problem you need more help than I can give
2010-09-07 01:54:11	Azerthoth	sabayonweb_52792, you need to install the driver,  nvidia-drivers-173.14.27   is probably what you need for that card
2010-09-07 01:54:29	Shawn_	Azerthoth, Oh wait I didnt realise that catting and md5summing the .md5 gave different numbers
2010-09-07 01:54:33	Azerthoth	sabayonweb_52792, you can boot the previous kernel
2010-09-07 01:54:43	Shawn_	Azerthoth, The first time I checked I did md5sum /path/to/.md5
2010-09-07 01:54:51	Shawn_	When I catted it instead it matched
2010-09-07 01:54:55	Shawn_	My mistake Im sorry
2010-09-07 01:55:01	Azerthoth	you dont md5sum the md5 file, you md5 file
2010-09-07 01:55:07	Shawn_	Yeah
2010-09-07 01:55:11	Shawn_	My mistake sorry about that
2010-09-07 01:55:30	Shawn_	I md5ed both the .iso and the .md5 for whatever reason
2010-09-07 01:55:33	Azerthoth	sabayabadu, I have no experiance using that software, never needed it
2010-09-07 01:56:01	sabayonweb_52792	The previous kernel does not appear, seems that I do not change it
2010-09-07 01:56:04	Azerthoth	sabayabadu, hit the forums up, may be documented there
2010-09-07 01:56:33	Azerthoth	sabayonweb_52792, you have X right now or no?

2010-09-07 02:20:40	Shawn_	Oops double posted
2010-09-07 02:20:54	Azerthoth	?? update-installer
2010-09-07 02:20:55	@|Cadmus|	update-installer[1]: as root: liveinst-update-quick
2010-09-07 02:20:57	@|Cadmus|	update-installer[2]: Yes, Installer updates ARE necessary.  Please do not ignore them.  They do more than just update the installer, they also contain bugfixes for the distro that will get applied prior to installation..
2010-09-07 02:22:04	Shawn_	This is on the Live CD
2010-09-07 02:22:08	Shinigami-Sama	Azerthoth: that doesn't exist on the KDE-x64 releases
2010-09-07 02:22:10	Shawn_	Using Anaconda
2010-09-07 02:22:13	AstralStorm	maybe someone should add that to the installer itself
2010-09-07 02:22:32	AstralStorm	Shinigami-Sama: it doesn't?
2010-09-07 02:22:36	Shinigami-Sama	no
2010-09-07 02:22:37	AstralStorm	it should be there.
2010-09-07 02:22:40	Shinigami-Sama	it isn't
2010-09-07 02:22:42	AstralStorm	that's a bug, go file it
2010-09-07 02:22:43	arkanabar	Shawn_: I just installed, and I did it too.
2010-09-07 02:22:43	Azerthoth	liveinst-update-quick ? thats part of spinbase IIRC
2010-09-07 02:22:46	Shinigami-Sama	I tried to usei t an it was gone
2010-09-07 02:22:58	AstralStorm	huh what..
2010-09-07 02:23:00	Shawn_	arkanabar, Did it end up going after a while?
2010-09-07 02:23:02	Shinigami-Sama	in the 5.3 plain releases its not there
2010-09-07 02:23:11	AstralStorm	hmm.
2010-09-07 02:23:22	Shinigami-Sama	no point in filing it 5.4 should be around soonish
2010-09-07 02:23:44	arkanabar	Shawn_: actually, my hang was from the searching for devices.  I killed the window, and it eventually moved on from there.
2010-09-07 02:23:58	Shawn_	Oh X_X
2010-09-07 02:23:59	Azerthoth	Shinigami-Sama, you need to be root to run it, but if its not in spinbase it needs to be on bugs
2010-09-07 02:24:05	Shawn_	Its hanging after I configured partitions
2010-09-07 02:24:09	arkanabar	there's a separate window for it, make sure you kill that an not the installer.
2010-09-07 02:24:26	Shawn_	Oh wow
2010-09-07 02:24:32	arkanabar	oh, ok.  not where I had my hang.
2010-09-07 02:24:39	Shinigami-Sama	Azerthoth: I"m seriously the only one that noticed it?
2010-09-07 02:24:51	Shawn_	"An unhandled exception has occured this is most likely a bug plesase save a copy of this bug and file it to sabayon developers"
2010-09-07 02:24:59	AstralStorm	arkanabar: device search failed on me as well with 5.3 Xfce before I learned about the updater
2010-09-07 02:25:11	Shawn_	This is so stupid.. So I guess the friggen 5.3 installer is broken
2010-09-07 02:25:21	Shawn_	That means my 3 times redownloading it
2010-09-07 02:25:22	AstralStorm	there was an issue with missing devices, it took a *huge* amount of time
2010-09-07 02:25:24	Shawn_	Were useless
2010-09-07 02:25:34	AstralStorm	Shawn_: just wait a few days for 5.4
2010-09-07 02:25:39	arkanabar	did you open a term, su and run liveinst-update-quick
2010-09-07 02:25:40	AstralStorm	yes, why would you redownload it for that purpose?
2010-09-07 02:25:47	arkanabar	then run the installer again.
2010-09-07 02:25:53	AstralStorm	arkanabar: yes and that didn't really fix it
2010-09-07 02:26:05	AstralStorm	instead of hanging, it took a *long* time to detect the missing cdrom drive
2010-09-07 02:26:12	Shawn_	AstralStorm, First I need a stable system for tomorrow second I redownloaded it again because everyone kept telling me 5.3 is working fine and that its a corrupt file
2010-09-07 02:26:18	Shawn_	And obviously they didnt know what they were talking about
2010-09-07 02:26:31	arkanabar	AstralStorm: didn't for me either.  but when I killed the device search window, the installer went on to ask me which partitions I wanted to use
2010-09-07 02:26:34	AstralStorm	yeah, they probably didn't know
2010-09-07 02:26:45	AstralStorm	esp. didn't know about md5sums that are available
2010-09-07 02:26:53	AstralStorm	and could be used to check for that
2010-09-07 02:27:03	Shinigami-Sama	Shawn_: install from text mode with partitioned devices
2010-09-07 02:27:04	AstralStorm	arkanabar: heh.
2010-09-07 02:27:14	Shinigami-Sama	txtmode isn't broken as easily
2010-09-07 02:27:20	AstralStorm	fortunately :)
2010-09-07 02:27:34	AstralStorm	but I really recommend waiting for 5.4 unless you're pressed for time
2010-09-07 02:27:42	Shawn_	I am really pressed for time
2010-09-07 02:27:43	AstralStorm	the upgrade will be *huge*
2010-09-07 02:28:00	AstralStorm	including new KDE
2010-09-07 02:28:05	Shawn_	I dont use KDE
2010-09-07 02:28:07	Shawn_	I despise it
2010-09-07 02:28:12	Shinigami-Sama	its better than gnome
2010-09-07 02:28:14	AstralStorm	which livecd then?
2010-09-07 02:28:17	Shinigami-Sama	?? gnome
2010-09-07 02:28:19	AstralStorm	Shinigami-Sama: no flamewars please
2010-09-07 02:28:19	Shawn_	Gnome
2010-09-07 02:28:22	arkanabar	oh, boy.  will there be a sane update method for installed systems?

2010-09-07 02:28:27	@|Cadmus|	gnome[3]: gnome users tend to be a bit backwards, see: http://tinyurl.com/gnome-gentoo
2010-09-07 02:28:30	AstralStorm	Shawn_: still a bit large update
2010-09-07 02:28:41	AstralStorm	arkanabar: yes, equo update && equo upgrade
2010-09-07 02:28:43	Azerthoth	I love that last link
2010-09-07 02:28:43	AstralStorm	as usual
2010-09-07 02:28:56	Shawn_	AstralStorm, Thats fine I will update then
2010-09-07 02:29:13	Shawn_	AstralStorm, I need this isntalled by tomorrow unfortunately
2010-09-07 02:29:35	AstralStorm	Azerthoth: I'd replace most of this silliness with one line: "The Macintosh of Linux user interfaces"
2010-09-07 02:30:05	AstralStorm	Shawn_: no, I mean the update *right now* is large :)
2010-09-07 02:30:12	AstralStorm	not that it will grow much larger
2010-09-07 02:30:22	AstralStorm	but yes, feel free to install
2010-09-07 02:30:36	AstralStorm	you'll just download about 1 or 1.5GB in upgrades
2010-09-07 02:30:43	Shawn_	Oh alright
2010-09-07 02:30:51	Shawn_	I can leave it going over night
2010-09-07 02:30:52	Shawn_	If needed
2010-09-07 02:31:20	Shinigami-Sama	AstralStorm: I think its more like 2-3gb
2010-09-07 02:31:24	AstralStorm	Shinigami-Sama: naah
2010-09-07 02:31:31	AstralStorm	not *that* much changes yet
2010-09-07 02:31:41	AstralStorm	or maybe
2010-09-07 02:31:42	AstralStorm	w/e
2010-09-07 02:31:46	Shinigami-Sama	yeah
2010-09-07 02:31:48	Shawn_	What makes all you guys hate GNOME so much to the point where you have a bot command that makes fun of it?
2010-09-07 02:31:49	AstralStorm	expect a dvdful of upgrades
2010-09-07 02:31:50	Shinigami-Sama	lots :P
2010-09-07 02:31:55	Shinigami-Sama	new everything
2010-09-07 02:31:56	Azerthoth	could always download a daily and pray
2010-09-07 02:32:09	AstralStorm	Shawn_: its dumbed-down interface - esp. cutting useful preferences
2010-09-07 02:32:19	Azerthoth	dailies being pretty much use at your own risk
2010-09-07 02:32:23	AstralStorm	yeah, the daily should work right now
2010-09-07 02:32:42	AstralStorm	since it's pretty close to 5.4
2010-09-07 02:33:56	Shawn_	Text installer is broke too

2010-09-07 02:36:50	Shawn_	Well unformatting it that is
2010-09-07 02:36:57	Shawn_	I think thats the problem maybe
2010-09-07 02:36:59	Shinigami-Sama	it doesn't have gparted
2010-09-07 02:37:08	Shinigami-Sama	it does have other parting tools though
2010-09-07 02:37:24	Shawn_	Does it have a tool that can unformat my drive?
2010-09-07 02:37:34	Shinigami-Sama	yes read up
2010-09-07 02:37:54	Shawn_	Whats it called
2010-09-07 02:38:33	genfool	fdisk
2010-09-07 02:38:48	Shawn_	Oh Ive used that too
2010-09-07 02:38:50	Shawn_	Okay good deal
2010-09-07 02:39:13	AstralStorm	actually, KDE is not so much an opposite of Gnome
2010-09-07 02:39:22	AstralStorm	it's a different version of Macintosh ;)
2010-09-07 02:39:32	AstralStorm	more bling and settings
2010-09-07 02:39:37	Shawn_	I think it may be because I currently have SLED installed it it made like a recovery partition that might not be able to be erased?
2010-09-07 02:39:38	Shawn_	Not sure
2010-09-07 02:39:51	AstralStorm	it has fdisk and parted
2010-09-07 02:39:54	Shawn_	I have used KDE before and got nothing but problems
2010-09-07 02:39:56	AstralStorm	not sure about gparted
2010-09-07 02:40:11	AstralStorm	I suppose you can handle yourself w/o GUI, right?
2010-09-07 02:40:28	Shawn_	Ive never used fdisk without GUI so no not really
2010-09-07 02:40:36	AstralStorm	it's simple menu-based
2010-09-07 02:40:45	Shawn_	Ill just burn a gparted ISO then maybe
2010-09-07 02:40:48	AstralStorm	nah
2010-09-07 02:40:50	Shawn_	instead of learning a new program
2010-09-07 02:40:58	AstralStorm	start the terminal, run fdisk /dev/<devicename>
2010-09-07 02:41:12	AstralStorm	and you'll see how simple it is to use
2010-09-07 02:41:17	Shawn_	Okay
2010-09-07 02:41:17	AstralStorm	even better, you can run cfdisk
2010-09-07 02:41:23	AstralStorm	it's there too and has even nicer text UI
2010-09-07 02:41:25	Shawn_	Whats the difference
2010-09-07 02:41:29	Shawn_	Okay
2010-09-07 02:41:40	Shawn_	All I wanna do is completely wipe my hard drive
2010-09-07 02:41:48	AstralStorm	trivial.
2010-09-07 02:41:53	Shawn_	?
2010-09-07 02:42:02	AstralStorm	in fdisk, enter d then number of the partition
2010-09-07 02:42:19	AstralStorm	as in, d <enter> and it will ask you for the number
2010-09-07 02:42:33	AstralStorm	rinse and repeat
2010-09-07 02:42:40	AstralStorm	afterwards, w <enter> to write the changes
2010-09-07 02:42:53	Shawn_	cfdisk not found
2010-09-07 02:42:57	AstralStorm	hmmh
2010-09-07 02:43:01	AstralStorm	so use fdisk instead then
2010-09-07 02:43:04	Shawn_	fdisk also not found
2010-09-07 02:43:06	AstralStorm	wha?
2010-09-07 02:43:09	AstralStorm	no, they're there
2010-09-07 02:43:14	AstralStorm	you have to be root
2010-09-07 02:43:15	Shawn_	Do I need to run as root
2010-09-07 02:43:15	genfool	need to be root
2010-09-07 02:43:17	Shawn_	Oh okay
2010-09-07 02:43:29	Shawn_	What is the root passowrd for live CD
2010-09-07 02:43:49	genfool	is blank   hit enter
2010-09-07 02:44:33	Shawn_	Uhh
2010-09-07 02:44:37	Shawn_	This could be a progblem
2010-09-07 02:44:59	Shawn_	Its only detecting the free space on the drive
2010-09-07 02:45:01	Shawn_	None of the partitions
2010-09-07 02:45:42	AstralStorm	are you sure you picked the right disk?
2010-09-07 02:45:48	AstralStorm	e.g. /dev/sdx
2010-09-07 02:45:56	Shawn_	/dev/sda
2010-09-07 02:46:00	AstralStorm	yes, that's fine
2010-09-07 02:46:05	AstralStorm	so the disk has no partitions
2010-09-07 02:46:29	AstralStorm	are you trying to install on a really new disk?
2010-09-07 02:46:41	AstralStorm	it might be missing the partition table altogether, fdisk can create a blank new one
2010-09-07 02:47:05	AstralStorm	that would be o <enter>
2010-09-07 02:47:08	genfool	hit p to print current partition table
2010-09-07 02:47:10	Shawn_	Hmm okay I typoed /dev/sda1
2010-09-07 02:47:13	AstralStorm	ahha
2010-09-07 02:47:15	AstralStorm	thought so
2010-09-07 02:47:16	Shawn_	So that was my bad
2010-09-07 02:47:27	Shawn_	Yeah I erased the partition on there
2010-09-07 02:47:29	arkanabar	woot, xchat's installed.  switching clients, brb.

2010-09-07 02:49:46	AstralStorm	dave_64: ... this is actually special
2010-09-07 02:49:50	arkanabar	nope, sorry, it used all cycles not devoted to anything else even after it finished installing xchat.
2010-09-07 02:50:01	AstralStorm	it just runs an equivalent of equo upgrade on start
2010-09-07 02:50:05	Shawn_	the SLED recovery partition totally musta bugged out anaconda (and the text installer as well)
2010-09-07 02:50:07	AstralStorm	to list the updates
2010-09-07 02:50:11	AstralStorm	oh indeed
2010-09-07 02:50:16	AstralStorm	arkanabar: that is a bug
2010-09-07 02:50:25	AstralStorm	do report it on bugs.sabayon.org

2010-09-07 02:52:19	arkanabar	beees: starting to think so myself.
2010-09-07 02:52:30	beees	equo's great
2010-09-07 02:52:56	beees	sulfur's fine for messing with some of the settings, but that's about it tbh
2010-09-07 02:53:06	Shawn_	Equo is just the text version of entropy sulfur isnt it?
2010-09-07 02:53:14	beees	yep
2010-09-07 02:53:23	beees	sulfur calls equo, iirc
2010-09-07 02:53:42	Shawn_	Yeah I usually hate graphical installer apps like that
2010-09-07 02:53:42	arkanabar	was about to say, more like the text backend.
2010-09-07 02:53:57	AstralStorm	beees: I think it doesn't
2010-09-07 02:54:05	AstralStorm	it's another interface into entropy
2010-09-07 02:54:20	AstralStorm	it's like, equo and sulfur are UIs for entropy backend
2010-09-07 02:54:26	beees	try installing something and checking top
2010-09-07 02:54:35	AstralStorm	hmm, interesting
2010-09-07 02:54:44	arkanabar	sulfur's finally calmed down.  I have top running.
2010-09-07 02:54:44	AstralStorm	but it does its own dependency resolution
2010-09-07 02:54:48	Shawn_	Im looking at the beginning Sabayon page and its saying run the command "equo install entropy sulfur equo -- relaxed" what do the things like --relaxed and --ask mean?
2010-09-07 02:54:58	beees	try equo install --help
2010-09-07 02:55:16	AstralStorm	Shawn_: --ask is trivial, relaxed means "don't look at dependencies"
2010-09-07 02:55:25	AstralStorm	if you know portage, it's like --oneshot
2010-09-07 02:55:35	Shawn_	Why dont I want to upgrade dependencies though
2010-09-07 02:55:38	AstralStorm	uh, no, like --nodeps

2010-09-07 02:55:50	beees	nodeps != relaxed o-o
2010-09-07 02:55:52	AstralStorm	because said dependencies might require newer entropy to handle
2010-09-07 02:55:57	AstralStorm	beees: are you sure?
2010-09-07 02:56:00	beees	yes
2010-09-07 02:56:08	beees	there's a separate --nodeps on equo
2010-09-07 02:56:17	AstralStorm	mhm, heh
2010-09-07 02:56:20	Shawn_	AstralStorm, So I shoudl always run with with --relaxed? I didnt know that I never did last time I installed sabayon
2010-09-07 02:56:27	AstralStorm	Shawn_: not always
2010-09-07 02:56:37	genfool	you would only use --relaxed if needed, was needed to update older entropy, not now though
2010-09-07 02:56:40	AstralStorm	usually it's not necessary
2010-09-07 02:56:46	Azerthoth	--relaxed is special case
2010-09-07 02:56:54	dave_64	i only used --relaxed once

2010-09-07 02:57:45	Azerthoth	typically comes from overly large variances between versions of entropy
2010-09-07 02:58:17	Shawn_	Well the beginner guide
2010-09-07 02:58:23	Shawn_	Tells me to use --ask and --relaxed

2010-09-07 02:58:26	AstralStorm	yes, the guide plays it safe
2010-09-07 02:58:33	AstralStorm	only for this one update

2010-09-07 02:58:55	AstralStorm	why, it asks you

2010-09-07 03:07:54	AstralStorm	for anything that doesn't require a gantt chart or iCal sync
2010-09-07 03:08:16	Azerthoth	gimme a steno pad for notes/task lists
2010-09-07 03:08:46	Azerthoth	or sticky notes

2010-09-07 03:42:29	AstralStorm	the real fun starts when a portage package requires a newer version than one in sabayon
2010-09-07 03:42:45	AstralStorm	*newer version of some dependency
2010-09-07 03:43:07	AstralStorm	because otherwise you might just install all the dependencies portage tries to install with equo/sulfur
2010-09-07 03:43:17	AstralStorm	and have less problem later on
2010-09-07 03:47:05	Shawn_	AstralStorm, Could I just isntall crossover with a .sh

2010-09-07 03:50:31	AstralStorm	Shawn_: you could
2010-09-07 03:50:48	AstralStorm	it probably will work
2010-09-07 03:51:45	arkanabar	AstralStorm: that looks pretty complicated.  I may be better off compiling nethack from source.
2010-09-07 03:53:48	AstralStorm	hmm?
2010-09-07 03:53:53	AstralStorm	unmasking nethack is hard?
2010-09-07 03:54:00	arkanabar	something I need to learn anyway, if I'm gonna get deep into linux.
2010-09-07 03:54:06	AstralStorm	just edit your /etc/portage/package.mask
2010-09-07 03:54:14	arkanabar	no, learning enough about both entropy and portage to safely use both at once.
2010-09-07 03:54:17	AstralStorm	?? portage > arkanabar
2010-09-07 03:54:36	AstralStorm	uhm, nethack has few deps, so it shouldn't be much of a problem
2010-09-07 03:55:34	AstralStorm	mixing isn't that hard anyway if you don't let portage update anything available from entropy
2010-09-07 03:56:14	AstralStorm	if you do though, you might run into issues similar to Gentoo upgrade problems, like having to use revdep-rebuild
2010-09-07 03:56:26	AstralStorm	and having to mask packages in entropy so that it doesn't attempt to downgrade
2010-09-07 03:56:26	arkanabar	ahhh.  Something to bear in mind.  Anyway, I was looking at the two links you had Cadmus bring up for Shawn.
2010-09-07 03:56:44	Shawn_	Im really considering just trying out Openoffice a bit more
2010-09-07 03:56:56	Shawn_	I mean people say its just as good
2010-09-07 03:57:00	Shawn_	Once you get used to it
2010-09-07 03:57:03	AstralStorm	it is good, yes
2010-09-07 03:57:17	AstralStorm	the UI is a bit cluttered (like older MS Office's)
2010-09-07 03:57:26	Shawn_	And then I can let go of one of my last holds onto MS (Besides my gaming computer)
2010-09-07 03:57:53	AstralStorm	oh, this reminds me I should write a bug to enable USE=binfilter for Sabayon's OOo package
2010-09-07 03:57:55	arkanabar	I gave up windows in 2008, when I upgraded WoW to WotLK.
2010-09-07 03:58:09	arkanabar	I had Win2k, and it required XP.  I didn't have the money.
2010-09-07 03:58:18	Shawn_	I dont play WoW I play FFXI and FFXIV when it comes out in September
2010-09-07 03:58:20	AstralStorm	hehe
2010-09-07 03:58:32	Shawn_	But I am definately an MMO junky
2010-09-07 03:58:40	Shawn_	I played WoW for a year though
2010-09-07 03:59:18	Shawn_	Does OO have any plans to change up its UI
2010-09-07 04:02:57	AstralStorm	WoW actually works good enough in wine nowadays
2010-09-07 04:03:10	Shawn_	Yeah I know

2010-09-07 04:53:21	AstralStorm	oh really? do you have compiz started?

2010-09-07 04:53:31	Shawn_	How can I check

2010-09-07 04:53:48	Shawn_	As root?
2010-09-07 04:53:50	AstralStorm	no
2010-09-07 04:54:13	Shawn_	Okay thats better

2010-09-07 04:55:34	Shawn_	Or is there a better way
2010-09-07 04:55:49	AstralStorm	well, that should do
2010-09-07 04:55:58	Shawn_	What should
2010-09-07 04:56:06	AstralStorm	adding the command to startup commands
2010-09-07 04:56:13	AstralStorm	there's another way, but it's highly fiddly

2010-09-07 05:06:04	AstralStorm	you mean that time setting app of Gnome? it should ask for root rights when you set the time

2010-09-07 09:33:06	Radtoo	Macbook pro -> bog standard laptop computer with a glowing apple logo and fancy power plug, in most cases manufactured by an actual bog standard Taiwanese/Chinese contractor of Apple... :p
2010-09-07 09:33:22	poundplay	lol
2010-09-07 09:33:46	poundplay	Do you know which version of sabayon i should use and how to properly set it up?
2010-09-07 09:34:02	Radtoo	Any should work, but I figure the kde or gnome dvd will suit most people best
2010-09-07 09:34:21	Radtoo	They should get you to a full-fledged desktop with quite many of the common apps installed.
2010-09-07 09:34:53	poundplay	well the mac i have is intel 64 bit so its been a bi%4h
2010-09-07 09:36:30	Radtoo	Gentoo supports the 64 bit processors since like 2005, sabayon is based on that - and with the exception of a few bad software vendors like Adobe (flash), everything is quite problem-free 64bit now.
2010-09-07 09:37:03	poundplay	yes but they do not have a x86_64 version
2010-09-07 09:37:12	Radtoo	Huh? Sure Gentoo does.
2010-09-07 09:37:16	Radtoo	And sabayon does.
2010-09-07 09:37:35	poundplay	sabayon does?
2010-09-07 09:37:42	Radtoo	Just 'cause gentoo supported it prior to intel coming out with 64bit cpu, it is called "amd64" ...
2010-09-07 09:37:49	Radtoo	Yes. Easy to find. -_0
2010-09-07 09:38:10	Radtoo	I'm not sure how you could miss the 64 bit editions, in fact...
2010-09-07 09:38:11	poundplay	okay i thought amd wouldnt work on intel. you rock.
2010-09-07 09:38:35	poundplay	i didnt know it was the same people
2010-09-07 09:38:46	poundplay	sorry ima noob
2010-09-07 09:39:46	Radtoo	No problem... hehe
2010-09-07 09:40:08	poundplay	so can i burn the md5 and iso on the same disk?
2010-09-07 09:40:16	Radtoo	No.
2010-09-07 09:40:19	poundplay	or can i merge them into one with image bur?
2010-09-07 09:40:29	Radtoo	No. they're not meant to be used that way
2010-09-07 09:40:30	poundplay	img burn*
2010-09-07 09:40:38	poundplay	okay
2010-09-07 09:40:57	Radtoo	The ISO need to be burnt as ISO (if you even burn it, usb stick may be faster).
2010-09-07 09:40:59	poundplay	cuz i did it on my hp mini and had to drop the md5 with the burnt iso onto it. together. odd
2010-09-07 09:41:14	Radtoo	Not as file. It needs to expand into a file system on the DVD.

2010-09-07 09:41:32	poundplay	okay makes sense.
2010-09-07 09:42:01	Radtoo	You can either use that or the .torrent file to make sure the file you downloaded has no errors.

2010-09-07 09:55:53	Radtoo	Just use the package manager the usual way - update equo/sulfur first, then update the rest minus kernel, then (if you want) update kernel and external modules.

2010-09-07 09:57:09	Radtoo	All of this is done with the package manager, of course. Hint, you'll probably not really economize much on download traffic if that's your goal, 5.2 -> 5.3 package-by-package will probably have roughly the same volume as downloading the 5.3 dvd...

2010-09-07 10:00:29	Radtoo	Not necessarily. It depends on user knowloedge. You might just have more problems installing and, in particular, configuring some of the stuff you install...
2010-09-07 10:01:11	poundplay	true patience in this case would be the virtue.

Whenever I try to link a WLM Messenger account, it says "Cannot load the WLM Messenger protocol plugin.". I've tried reinstalling Kopete and libmsn but it didn't work. I've been Googleing for a week now and I've tried every fix on the first three pages of Google, with no success. Does anyone here

2010-09-07 17:26:49	Enlik	But it's odd, there's Kopete (kde-base/kopete-4.4.5-r1) with msn USE flag and libmsn dependency, so in theory it should work I think
2010-09-07 17:27:49	Keshl	How would I do that? I'm still a half-newbie to Linux
2010-09-07 17:28:00	Enlik	What? Install Pidgin?
2010-09-07 17:28:05	Keshl	No, USE flag.
2010-09-07 17:28:38	Enlik	No, I said only it seems MSN is enabled in Kopete, so it should work...
2010-09-07 17:28:55	Keshl	I rather not use Pidgin -- There's someone around me that likes to try to shove software he uses down my throat. One of those was Pidgin, and I'd never hear the end of it if I ever used it, sooooo..
2010-09-07 17:29:35	Keshl	On top of that, I just like Kopete better in the first place.

2010-09-07 17:31:58	Enlik	Have you tried to run kopete from terminal and see if there's some output?

2010-09-07 17:40:16	Keshl	Okay. How would I get my hardware up on there? Is there a command I can run and paste in?
2010-09-07 17:40:33	AstralStorm	emerge --info is good for that
2010-09-07 17:40:50	AstralStorm	although hardware info is rarely necessary
2010-09-07 17:41:11	AstralStorm	equo --info might be enough as well
2010-09-07 17:41:35	Keshl	I'm the only person here with this bug (I think). I'm using a vanella Sabayon 5.2 install upgraded to 5.3 (didn't work on 5.2 either). I don't see any reason this can be happening except for some weird hardware.

2010-09-07 17:53:18	AstralStorm	Keshl: doesn't really matter. if you're not using limbo, pick the normal Sabayon Linux
2010-09-07 17:53:27	Keshl	Well, I did install from a daily -- Twas a while back though. Should I keep it marked as DAILY, or would that just confuse people?

2010-09-07 17:53:42	AstralStorm	yes, it would cause confusion

2010-09-07 18:16:22	AstralStorm	yes? what's the suggestion?
2010-09-07 18:16:44	Keshl	Every time I do a massive update, I watch all the output like a hawk and see a ton of "make sure you run such-and-such after installing" or "make sure to cinfugre this-and-that", etc. These eventually scroll off the screen to where I can't see them anymore and I'm always afraid I'll brake something. Could you fork Equo's output so it *always* writes output to a file as well as Konsole, if it thinks it'll run out of room?

2010-09-07 18:40:04	gh0stn0te	guys, i would like to have some help 2 figure out of a strange pulseaudio (or alsa) thing... whatever i do, i get no audio from my soundcard (Creative X-fi ROG, bundled with asus Rampage II mobo's)... before i ve launched alsaconf (cause i was getting only the 50% of output gain) to watch at the volume controls all was appearing ok..
2010-09-07 18:40:06	Keshl	Enlik: No problem.

2010-09-07 18:41:35	gh0stn0te	the strange thing is that pulseaudio seems to recognize my audiocard as a Analog Stereo Duplex (and that is ok!)
2010-09-07 18:42:27	Keshl	Shawn-: Astral was telling me as you left to make sure you've got the right version -- I think there might be different drivers for older cards. What card do you have?
2010-09-07 18:42:53	gh0stn0te	I would like to understand why now, before reinstalling everything or setting up OSS
2010-09-07 18:43:28	Keshl	Gh0st: Is your volume muted? Once, after updateing my card, it muted it. Just ran alsamixer and turned everything up one by one until I heard sound.
2010-09-07 18:44:00	Shawn-	keshl nvidia geforce 9600 m gs
2010-09-07 18:44:15	Keshl	Gh0st: Sometimes it'll mute the master volume, other times just one part of the mixer, maybe it'll turn "External" off... My updates were weird. o.O
2010-09-07 18:44:39	AstralStorm	Shawn-: quite interesting
2010-09-07 18:44:51	Keshl	Shawn-: my 9800 is covered under nvidia-drivers, but I think I remember seeing 9600 as a seproate package... Try "equo search nvidia"?
2010-09-07 18:44:51	gh0stn0te	Keshl actually, i dont get any type of audio since i ve run (for the first time) alsaconf and alsamixer... in alsamixer anyway, all is up and un-muted!
2010-09-07 18:44:53	AstralStorm	it should work with the latest drivers
2010-09-07 18:45:33	Shawn-	not sure what to do now on the new kernel it no longer goes to a blue error screen now it just starts to load x and then hangs at a beige screen

2010-09-07 18:56:48	AstralStorm	the which module?
2010-09-07 18:57:20	Shawn-	therres like 9 cells how do I find the right one
2010-09-07 18:57:21	AstralStorm	are those some acronyms I don't know?
2010-09-07 18:57:32	AstralStorm	Shawn-: hmm, one of these without encryption
2010-09-07 18:57:37	gh0stn0te	the "Yes" module, used by emerald theme manager & others... everytime i run compiz, it seems to be blocked, i get a lot of graphic issue and i cant change theme :\
2010-09-07 18:57:53	Keshl	Shawn-: Guess at the ones that don't have encryption. Look for the one with the strongest signal (If it lists them).
2010-09-07 18:58:20	AstralStorm	oh, and it will say Mode:Managed probably
2010-09-07 18:58:24	AstralStorm	(not Ad-hoc)
2010-09-07 18:58:31	Keshl	Shawn-: Do    #  iwconfig wlan0 essid (name of network here) && dhclient wlan0

2010-09-07 18:59:08	gh0stn0te	the Compiz error stack says everytime that compiz cant find that module (but actually is used by the theme in use!)

2010-09-07 19:01:05	Keshl	Shawn-: nevermind, listen to Astral. I'm dumb today.

2010-09-07 19:03:01	AstralStorm	so you get to run: pastebunz /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-09-07 19:03:08	AstralStorm	that will pastebin that file

2010-09-07 19:03:32	AstralStorm	gh0stn0te: really weird too. which sabayon version is that?
2010-09-07 19:03:42	gh0stn0te	latest

2010-09-07 19:08:44	AstralStorm	of course, upgrade your system

2010-09-07 19:09:59	AstralStorm	you have to install emerald yourself
2010-09-07 19:10:02	gh0stn0te	got it, thanks for the clarification

2010-09-07 19:36:09	gh0stn0te	maybe is an emerald problem

2010-09-07 21:21:13	Radtoo	gh0stn0te: then use the update manager tool for android to set up and run a virtual android device thingie. then use this: http://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin/tree/master/script/ to set up a perfectly nice environment for android development and run sbt in it :D

2010-09-07 21:22:23	Radtoo	gh0stn0te: You'll have an instant tool chain that allows you to directly compile sources, package them, run proguard on them (slims em down), run test cases, and install them in an emulator, in one simple "install-emulator" command...

2010-09-07 21:23:32	gh0stn0te	Radtoo i was thinkin... its better to use the Eclipse Classic ide or the Java edition on linux?
2010-09-07 21:23:55	Radtoo	I don't care, I use IDEA and vim, mainly.
2010-09-07 21:24:08	gh0stn0te	OK! thanks
2010-09-07 21:24:18	Radtoo	But it shouldn't matter... now, I figure you could just install eclipse-sdk through the package manager?
2010-09-07 21:24:35	Radtoo	I think that one is the java edition... either way, what plugins you deploy later is not much of a big deal

2010-09-07 23:34:35	gh0stAndroidDev	thanks
2010-09-07 23:35:13	Radtoo	gh0stAndroidDev: just create src/java/ ... whatever and it should be as good for java as for scala - oh, but if you run junit3 tests, you need a plugin in the project config for that.
2010-09-07 23:36:32	Radtoo	gh0stAndroidDev: and junit4. simple to add, tho. but just test/src/java won't work otherwise 'cause it does not look for junit tests in this version yet without the plugin.  Anyhow, despite all this, its still a very simple and powerful way to do the development for android, by no means it is fun to set up proguard and co in other ways... or as portable between machines.
2010-09-07 23:37:13	Radtoo	gh0stAndroidDev: BTW, scala of course is also cool. Some have concluded it actually works better on android in some cases than java. :p

2010-09-08 00:42:09	joost_op	I'd play around with it first

2010-09-08 00:42:30	joost_op	and then move to updates
2010-09-08 00:43:12	joost_op	but then it shouldn't be a problem to install the updates
2010-09-08 00:43:36	renai_idenshi	ok, will do that, also it won't let me install other apps without doing the updates, but i guess if i delete al from the list, can't find a skip option
2010-09-08 00:43:39	joost_op	We are close to a Sabayon 5.4 release

2010-09-08 00:47:02	joost_op	there is no need to reinstall

2010-09-08 00:52:58	Keshl	Last night, someone (not someone here) walked me through installing gpg 1.x, which solved the issue. I compiled it and didn't actually *install* it, so I didn't interfere with equo and your uipdates.
2010-09-08 00:53:19	joost_op	file a bug
2010-09-08 00:53:24	Keshl	My question is: Are there any major security flaws in gpg 1.x that are addressed in 2.x, and, if so, how would I get 2.x working properly with Thudnjerbird and ENigmail?

2010-09-08 01:07:30	Keshl	You should, it's not like it's hard with Sabayon. Most of them go "O.O That's pretty! How'd you get it?!" or "So that's Linux, eh? Someone said it was a lot more complex.." *just* from looking at the desktop.

2010-09-08 01:11:07	Keshl	Radtoo: That makes sense, but I'm talking about the learning curve. People around here took about two months to get comfortable with windows and literally a day to catch onto Sabayon, even ones that never used a computer before. My technophobic grandfather uses it.
2010-09-08 01:11:23	joost_op	you needed to use Gentoo portage and compile all your things using complicated stuff
2010-09-08 01:11:54	joost_op	so when Fabio explained to me what he wanted todo I hooked up and became the packager

2010-09-08 01:12:44	joost_op	you get things pre compiled through entropy
2010-09-08 01:13:00	Keshl	I use Equo, actually.. But I used to use Entropy.
2010-09-08 01:13:01	joost_op	isn't that something
2010-09-08 01:13:07	Keshl	But that is quite amazing.
2010-09-08 01:13:12	Keshl	I didn't think one guy did it all.
2010-09-08 01:13:14	joost_op	equo is Entropy
2010-09-08 01:13:18	Keshl	....OH O.O
2010-09-08 01:13:26	Radtoo	Keshl: Why not. From an usability POV at least the menu in kde or gnome is clearly less nuts than the windows ones.
2010-09-08 01:13:30	joost_op	Entropy is the collective name
2010-09-08 01:13:34	Keshl	So *thaaaat's* where Entropy went..
2010-09-08 01:13:47	joost_op	we call it Entropy
2010-09-08 01:13:56	Radtoo	Keshl: if you just set up icons to click on the desktop however, I don't think that's any different between win and sabayon, eh... :P
2010-09-08 01:13:59	joost_op	th eclient tools to use it are Equo and sulfur
2010-09-08 01:14:27	joost_op	I know it is a complicated namespace
2010-09-08 01:14:35	Keshl	Radtoo: Exactly. That's actually what gets most of them to come over and try Sabayon. They think it's beautiful, but are afraid to use it. All I do is bring the start menu up and they try it after seeing how simple and sorted it is.
2010-09-08 01:14:49	joost_op	and I bet you dunno what kinda power you actually have under the hood
2010-09-08 01:15:03	Keshl	Joost, don't worry, I get it, and I don't know what kinda power I have, probably <.<
2010-09-08 01:15:11	joost_op	but believe me, you have the power to modify anything you want
2010-09-08 01:15:25	Keshl	Oh, that kind of power. I knew that, it's another reason I use Linux.

2010-09-08 01:17:44	joost_op	Keshl: the infra is simple
2010-09-08 01:17:48	Keshl	Radtoo: Normally I'd worry about that, but Sabayon's already got what they want and need installed and they rarely actually *have* to update it. Not telling them how to blow their own heads off works. Sure, it's not in the true Linux spirit, but I only start this a week ago (and got about ten people into it by going out three times!), and I want to get the word out that it's easy to use...
2010-09-08 01:17:50	Keshl	...before I go technical on them.
2010-09-08 01:18:01	joost_op	we use Gentoo ebuilds t o compile sources for Entropy
2010-09-08 01:18:20	joost_op	whatever is not in Portage OR whatever we want to have different
2010-09-08 01:18:34	joost_op	we have our own ebuilds for, called overlay
2010-09-08 01:18:57	joost_op	combined with gentoo portage I built packages
2010-09-08 01:19:09	joost_op	to get excactly what we want
2010-09-08 01:19:34	joost_op	this way it is possible to have a 10 man army working on things
2010-09-08 01:20:00	joost_op	and just 1 to package things for Entropy
2010-09-08 01:20:02	Radtoo	Of course not entirely 10 man focused on packages - joost here is the guy who does most of the package building for sabayon. :P
2010-09-08 01:20:25	joost_op	like 99%
2010-09-08 01:20:32	Radtoo	Right.
2010-09-08 01:20:36	joost_op	the overlay team does the ebuilds

2010-09-08 01:22:52	Keshl	I'm on windows right now -- the only reason I'm not on Sabayon is because I need to use MSN. Meebo won't log properly and I have a grudge against Pidgin.

2010-09-08 01:32:35	Keshl	I want something that supports stuff like MsgPlus does. If possible I'd spend upto eight gigs JUST to install the real MSN in Wine, just so I can run the "stats center" plugin for Plus.
2010-09-08 01:33:29	Keshl	...-stupid- I could just install Windows in VirtualBox and run it from there. <.<

2010-09-08 04:27:50	Keshl	There's a special format, sec..
2010-09-08 04:29:16	Keshl	assuming no password, try   mkdir /mnt/ftpdirectory && mount ftp://USERNAME@128.128.128.128 /mnt/ftpdirectory

2010-09-08 05:06:05	Keshl	Whoever maintains the packages here lied to me, then. Back on 4.1 I installed every DE I mentioned (I was *really* bored), and never got any duplicates.
2010-09-08 05:06:30	Azerthoth|D	*cough* bullshit
2010-09-08 05:06:40	Shawn_	Azerthoth|D, Thats what I thought

2010-09-08 05:08:38	Keshl	Ah <.<
2010-09-08 05:08:47	Azerthoth|D	Gnome and KDE apps will show in the other's menu's
2010-09-08 05:09:37	Keshl	I know *that* happens.
2010-09-08 05:09:41	Azerthoth|D	fluxbox, any app that it recognizes will show if you tell it to autogenerate a menu
2010-09-08 05:09:59	Keshl	I was talking about, say, if, Kopete came with both Gnome and KDE -- You'd have two Kopete's in the menu.
2010-09-08 05:10:11	Azerthoth|D	because its only installed once
2010-09-08 05:10:26	Keshl	That never happened with me. I *did* see other applications I put in on KDE inside of GNOME and vice versa, but I never had six Kopete's at once.
2010-09-08 05:10:35	Keshl	That's what we were asking about, I believe.
2010-09-08 05:10:40	Azerthoth|D	because they are only installed once
2010-09-08 05:10:49	Keshl	Exactly.
2010-09-08 05:10:56	Azerthoth|D	packages are packages are packages
2010-09-08 05:11:09	Keshl	But are they packages? -- Sorry, couldn't resist. <.<

2010-09-08 05:11:25	Shawn_	What I meant by duplicates I didnt mean two of the SAME program
2010-09-08 05:11:43	Shawn_	I meant I didnt like having a GNOME music player AND a KDE music player both showing up ALL the time
2010-09-08 05:11:51	Keshl	"When I install KDE Im sure Ill get duplicate apps to do the same things as in the other one.."
2010-09-08 05:11:52	Shawn_	And same for every program
2010-09-08 05:11:59	Azerthoth|D	and the answer to that is, if any package follows LDS then yes
2010-09-08 05:12:08	Keshl	...OHHH, okay, my bad. Sorry, misunderstood that.
2010-09-08 05:15:12	genfool	either way, not going to hurt anything, take up space. You worried about space, you would not be adding multiple de's

2010-09-08 07:42:58	Keshl	Got another question.. So, I noticed a while back that Sabayon was trying to get like, $5,000 in donations for a server with about 9 gigs of RAM, a quad core processor and some amount of hard disc space. Gateway, at the same time, was selling a PC with 9 gigs DDR3 ram, octal core processor and 750 gig hard drive for $1,300. Is there any reason to go with a rackmount server rather than a...
2010-09-08 07:43:00	Keshl	...desktop, even when the savings are this extreme?

2010-09-08 11:29:02	Radtoo	Maybe glowing leds are just an unimplemented feature in the driver.

2010-09-08 18:20:03	seeds	what's the difference?
2010-09-08 18:22:08	vsTerminus	Several differences.
2010-09-08 18:22:31	vsTerminus	For one, portage (emerge) compiles packages from source code. Equo installed pre-compiled binaries
2010-09-08 18:22:54	seeds	k
2010-09-08 18:22:55	vsTerminus	They also each have their own repositories.
2010-09-08 18:23:06	seeds	cool
2010-09-08 18:23:19	vsTerminus	That's the bulk of the difference, I need to know more about your "mad issues" though
2010-09-08 18:23:26	seeds	in your opinion which one is better?
2010-09-08 18:23:46	vsTerminus	'better' doesn't work. 'better suited to your situation' maybe...
2010-09-08 18:24:18	vsTerminus	In which case, portage (emerge) is not good for less powerful CPUs
2010-09-08 18:24:41	vsTerminus	Since equo doesn't have to compile anything it's easier on your CPU to install software.
2010-09-08 18:24:45	vsTerminus	Faster, too.

2010-09-08 18:44:31	vsTerminus	I don't know about laptop_mode really but if you're concerned about not using the hard drive I would suggest booting from a Live DVD and not mounting the disk at all

2010-09-08 18:45:28	Keshl	I've got a faulty PSU that can't be easily replaced -- Sleep mode takes 100 watts, the hard drive takes like 20-30..
2010-09-08 18:46:04	Keshl	It's not even an old one, I don't get why it's doing this, but it does. Hence where my next question comes from..

2010-09-08 18:46:33	Keshl	My desktop is running behind a UPS, which can run it for 15 minutes while the computer is on, or 30 while in sleep. When we actually get an outage, we usually have it for a few days.
2010-09-08 18:47:13	Keshl	When I saw Sabayon had TuxOnIce, I deleted Swap (I've got nine gigs of ram, didn't really need it for anything but hibernation) since TOE can hibernate to a file, rather than swap.

2010-09-08 19:14:02	vsTerminus	As far as spinning down your hard drives, it looks like SATA drives manage that themselves when idle

2010-09-08 19:14:15	vsTerminus	but to keep them idle you need to turn off access times in your fstab

2010-09-08 19:14:22	Keshl	I know they do, but on my laptop I can do sdparm -S 5 and it'll spin down after 90 seconds.

2010-09-08 19:43:43	vsTerminus	What seems to be the problem?
2010-09-08 19:43:47	vsTerminus	Ah
2010-09-08 19:43:49	Keshl	COmpiz isn't installed in 5.3
2010-09-08 19:43:54	sabayonweb_70510	ok
2010-09-08 19:43:56	vsTerminus	Especially for KDE
2010-09-08 19:44:02	sabayonweb_70510	cool
2010-09-08 19:44:07	sabayonweb_70510	thats my problem then lol
2010-09-08 19:44:08	Keshl	Just use "Desktop effects" (Search start menu)
2010-09-08 19:44:08	vsTerminus	KWin now does everything that Compiz does (mostly anyway)
2010-09-08 19:44:23	vsTerminus	Yup.

2010-09-08 19:44:31	sabayonweb_70510	cool
2010-09-08 19:44:46	Keshl	It's not exactly like Compiz's, but for most people it's good enough.
2010-09-08 19:45:07	vsTerminus	Yea, it lacks some multi-monitor stuff
2010-09-08 19:45:09	vsTerminus	unfortunately
2010-09-08 19:45:20	sabayonuser	what version of gcc matches the 2.6.34 kernel
2010-09-08 19:45:22	Keshl	If you're really desperate, you can still install COmpiz via Equo. Just *don't use the compiz-fusion-icon. It's horribly bugged.*
2010-09-08 19:45:24	sabayonuser	gcc and kernel headers must be installed
2010-09-08 19:45:59	vsTerminus	sabayonuser: gcc and kernel version don't have to match.
2010-09-08 19:46:14	sabayonuser	VMware seems to think they do

2010-09-08 20:11:42	vsTerminus	sabayonweb_56496: Gentoo is a source based distro, meaning everything you install is compiled from source code. This can be a good thing, but is also a lot slower.
2010-09-08 20:12:01	vsTerminus	Sabayon can use Gentoo's installation method, as well as its own (Entropy) which is more like apt

2010-09-08 20:28:29	vsTerminus	Check that against the md5sum provided from one of the download mirrors

2010-09-08 20:36:19	vsTerminus	Do you want KDE or Gnome?

2010-09-08 20:36:32	sabayonweb_22639	prefer 32 tho
2010-09-08 20:36:35	Keshl	I'd go with KDE for people migrating from Windows.
2010-09-08 20:36:41	sabayonweb_22639	kde

2010-09-08 20:36:48	Keshl	Ditto <.<
2010-09-08 20:36:58	Keshl	KDE == windows migration, GNOME == mac.

2010-09-08 20:42:18	Keshl	Then when it gives you the number, you open the .md5 file in Notepad and check if they matchj.

2010-09-08 23:46:38	Keshl	89190: The easy answer is to just install Sabayon :) But if you insist on using windows, try using a wired connection first. Vista and 7 don't like wifi sometimes.

2010-09-08 23:48:02	sabayonweb_89180	Trust me, if the programs my company uses worked with wine or anything i'd be installing sabayon on all this POS's

2010-09-08 23:53:31	sabayonweb_10961	yeah just installed
2010-09-08 23:53:46	Keshl	Okay, you'll need to close every program except for Konsole when you do these steps, then.
2010-09-08 23:53:57	sabayonweb_10961	its done i think
2010-09-08 23:53:59	Keshl	Do you know how to use Nano or Vi to take notes?
2010-09-08 23:54:08	sabayonweb_10961	i did what you said and it did lots of suff lol
2010-09-08 23:54:20	Keshl	Oh, it took? Okay then... Nevermind me.
2010-09-08 23:54:33	Keshl	Hold alt and press f2. In the box that comes up, type "kdesu nvidia-settings"
2010-09-08 23:54:35	sabayonweb_10961	so what now
2010-09-08 23:54:45	Keshl	configure from there. Don't voerclock your card, it *will* brake something.

2010-09-08 23:55:28	Keshl	Sublime: You need to assign it via the router, too.
2010-09-08 23:55:40	Sublime	not necessarily
2010-09-08 23:55:51	Keshl	10961: it appears at the top of the screen, it's just a box you can type it. It's kinda hard to see if your screen is big.
2010-09-08 23:56:04	Keshl	10961: If you're certain it's not there, you can just run it from Konsole, too.
2010-09-08 23:56:14	sabayonweb_10961	nothing at all
2010-09-08 23:56:36	Keshl	10961: Odd... Well, just get it from Konsole, then.
2010-09-08 23:56:48	Sublime	well, i think it worked
2010-09-08 23:56:54	Sublime	why i never thought of doing that before is beyond me

2010-09-08 23:57:04	Keshl	Sublime: It's simple, you're smart. Therefore, it's hard to think of.

2010-09-09 00:00:11	Keshl	10961: Then open a *NEW* Konsole, and type "pastebunz" into it. It'll look frozen once you do, that's normal.

2010-09-09 00:03:29	sabayonweb_10961	k

2010-09-09 02:23:12	dave_64	i would think that should work, but you could install a newer kernel.  are you getting good performance otherwise?
2010-09-09 02:23:47	Keshl	Yes, jsut fine except for a USB bug. Someone said I should update the ekrnel, but someone was here last night who did that and it completely broke the X server (on *both* kernels), so he had to reinstall.

2010-09-09 02:44:58	Azerthoth	Keshl, if you bounce around on kernels you have to adjust all packages and modules to match if they are kernel dependent
2010-09-09 02:45:10	Azerthoth	everything in vbox is kernel specific

2010-09-09 02:48:51	Keshl	Someone said I have to update my drivers for nvidia, then.
2010-09-09 02:49:08	Keshl	Yesterday, someone did just that -- BOTH kernel's X servers broke and there was no way to revert the driver.
2010-09-09 02:49:11	dave_64	yes, that's not hard
2010-09-09 02:50:02	PaddyMac	Downgrading is usually harder than upgrading to be sure.
2010-09-09 02:50:51	Keshl	Agreed, but the thing is, he had to reinstall his OS. I'd rather not do that.
2010-09-09 02:55:21	genfool	Keshl, is easy to switch from one kernel to another...and mask newer drivers if needed...few people need to do this...usually operator error.
2010-09-09 02:55:39	Keshl	What does it mean to "mask" it, anyway?
2010-09-09 02:55:49	dave_64	i can understand that a kernel upgrade might cause a problem with x, but i can't believe it would break the whole system, and require a reinstall...you should be able to revert back to the 34 kernel without problems

2010-09-09 03:34:07	dave_64	Keshl: yes,   and if it is not set to 35, you need to set it (eselect kernel set x     where x is the number of the 35 kernel....probably 2, in your case
2010-09-09 03:34:37	Keshl	Okay. -taking notes-

2010-09-09 05:06:11	Keshl	There's no buttons to press and the command "compiz-kde-launcher" isn't in the Konsole, so I'm guessing I'd have to put a .conf file (or something similar) somewhere..

2010-09-09 05:16:32	Keshl	genfool: Just for the record, the update did actually fix alot of things. The system doesn't spend 15 seconds at "initalizing kernel", it only spends five now. It logs in in about five seconds too, usually takes ten, and my screensaver is the one where it types text and emulates an old display (from xscreensaver). The first character of the first line is usually missing, but that's not anymore either, so thanks so far!

2010-09-09 05:36:50	Espreon	For the lulz, I guess. Sometimes, I'll play around with the kernel config. In this case, I just used the normal configuration; I changed nothing.
2010-09-09 05:36:55	Keshl	Espreon: I had the same problem with .34, .35 fixed it for me. I'm not sure if that'd help you at all, but there it is.

2010-09-09 10:49:04	Keshl	No problem. By the way, you cna just use "Konversation" to get back here instead of going through Firefox. It's faster and looks better, in my oppinion.

2010-09-09 10:54:25	Keshl	I don't know how to do this, but I remember seeing somewhere that you have to tell Linux to re-detect changes in hardware. You might wanna Google around a bit, or just wait until someone who knows more than me comes on.

It hangs until I do, it's really freaky x.x' But it might just be the framebuffer, dunno), and 67080 needs some help getting Linux to pick up his new RAM. Could you help either of us?

2010-09-09 11:18:37	wolfden	that is emerald issue
2010-09-09 11:18:45	Keshl	Second, to change windows, I hold my mouse over them and they get focus.
2010-09-09 11:18:45	joost_op	install the window decorator too
2010-09-09 11:18:49	Keshl	How do I stop the second one?
2010-09-09 11:18:52	joost_op	equop install emerals
2010-09-09 11:18:54	joost_op	equop install emerald
2010-09-09 11:19:08	joost_op	then restart fusion icon
2010-09-09 11:19:17	Keshl	Okai.
2010-09-09 11:19:27	joost_op	2. open the compiz settings thing and enable viewport switcher

The same sort of thing happens with erasing text and various other things.  I have no idea where the proble

2010-09-09 21:11:00	Radtoo	just check in cccsm, compizconfig settings manager - or how that's called.

2010-09-09 21:27:27	xeviox	compiz seems to have a problem with my ati notebook card ..
2010-09-09 21:27:31	Keshl	Is there any way I can capture a movie on my desktop?
2010-09-09 21:27:44	Keshl	(Linux doens't mix well with ATI -- It never did, and probably never will.)
2010-09-09 21:27:55	Keshl	(While Sabayon does have support for it, it's nowhere near as good as nVidia.)
2010-09-09 21:27:59	Radtoo	Keshl: recordmydesktop, xvidcapture, quite a bunch of command line ways ...
2010-09-09 21:28:16	Keshl	Radtoo: SO much easier than paying $150 in windows..
2010-09-09 21:28:34	Keshl	That dollar sign honestly looks foregin now.
2010-09-09 21:28:43	Radtoo	Ati had and has poor binary only drivers. the open source radeon driver should work better and is probably enough for compiz.
2010-09-09 21:29:04	Radtoo	Keshl: Hm? Paying 150$ in windows for what?
2010-09-09 21:29:05	Keshl	and, Radtoo, the reason is, I'm superstitithasd
2010-09-09 21:29:14	Keshl	grr. <.< Can't spell it.
2010-09-09 21:29:28	Keshl	Radtoo: A piece of software to record my desktop, and save it as an .avi or .exe.

2010-09-09 21:31:25	Radtoo	.avi is a container, basically all of 'em.
2010-09-09 21:31:56	Radtoo	xvidcap and recordmydesktop should both support it, I think.

2010-09-09 21:32:35	Keshl	xeviox: It's one of the themes in Emerald (I think), and if you look around it should, SHOULD be in compiz-settings.

2010-09-09 21:58:39	Radtoo	Keshl: saves you the latter conversion. Basically, run capture -> desktop and then convert/save if you want to use vlc's feature.

2010-09-10 20:01:57	AstralStorm	they're iso all right, just funny file names

2010-09-10 20:03:57	nicklas_	so i just put .iso at end of file name?
2010-09-10 20:04:08	Keshl	Compare the MD5sum first, but otherwise yeah.
2010-09-10 20:04:21	nicklas_	or do i copy paste the regular download names?
2010-09-10 20:04:31	Keshl	Just add .iso.
2010-09-10 20:04:50	Keshl	Roxio's just confused because it's not seeing ".iso" at the end. That's all it cares about.

2010-09-10 20:05:27	Keshl	AstralStorm: This will interest you. So, the most recent update switched me back from Compiz to KDE. I decided to ignore it and use KDE for a while to see if I really cared that much for the effects (and I found out I do), but, the interesting bit is, *the freezes still happened in KDE. This issue doens't only apply to Compiz*.
2010-09-10 20:06:01	AstralStorm	what freezes and which driver?
2010-09-10 20:06:14	AstralStorm	and which card of course
2010-09-10 20:06:20	Keshl	propritary nVidia driver, I ahve refresh/redraw issues. nVidia 260 GTX.
2010-09-10 20:06:20	AstralStorm	might be just trivial overheating

2010-09-10 20:06:45	AstralStorm	nvidia being the annoying propietary driver
2010-09-10 20:06:57	AstralStorm	maybe you could try nouveau just to see if it's driver-related
2010-09-10 20:07:04	Keshl	The guys at Compiz (Promptly after telling me they never actually use Compiz) told me to use Nouveau.

2010-09-10 20:24:31	AstralStorm	lythandrel: yes, but what matters for compiz is texture_from_pixmap
2010-09-10 20:24:40	Keshl	lythandrel: I don't count "just output" as "doing something". I was reading it as "doing some processing work". My bad.
2010-09-10 20:24:42	@lythandrel	unless it's changed in the last 3 months, all that information was on their page.
2010-09-10 20:24:43	AstralStorm	and opengl surface
2010-09-10 20:24:46	AstralStorm	so not really all that much
2010-09-10 20:25:17	AstralStorm	it changes quickly
2010-09-10 20:25:26	AstralStorm	last 3 months is like an age for that drive
2010-09-10 20:25:28	AstralStorm	*driver
2010-09-10 20:26:18	sabayonuser	gcc error: gcc: error trying to exec 'as': execvp: No such file or directory

2010-09-10 20:26:44	sabayonuser	tried equo install --deep gcc to no avail
2010-09-10 20:27:33	AstralStorm	run env-update as root, then source /etc/profile
2010-09-10 20:27:45	AstralStorm	oh, and as is not part of gcc, but binutils
2010-09-10 20:27:57	AstralStorm	eselect binutils list and eselect binutils set <number>
2010-09-10 20:27:59	AstralStorm	just to be sure
2010-09-10 20:28:02	AstralStorm	before that env-update
2010-09-10 20:28:03	@lythandrel	sabayonuser: also helps if you have kernel source
2010-09-10 20:28:16	AstralStorm	nah
2010-09-10 20:28:19	AstralStorm	he does have them

2010-09-10 20:28:54	@lythandrel	that's better
2010-09-10 20:29:00	AstralStorm	lythandrel: but I'd expect you to read the backlog :)
2010-09-10 20:29:10	silasdavis	oh my god, the intellect, rushing in
2010-09-10 20:29:25	Keshl	AstralStorm: I'm a noob at IRC, how do you get into said backlog? That'd help me a *lot* in some places.
2010-09-10 20:29:36	silasdavis	so, any ideas, it sounds familiar to me, but I can't find anything particularly promising so far...
2010-09-10 20:29:48	silasdavis	Keshl: you use a client that logs
2010-09-10 20:29:49	@lythandrel	Keshl: there's a scrollbar on one of the sides of your irc client..
2010-09-10 20:29:50	AstralStorm	Keshl: the basic is shift+pgup/pgdown
2010-09-10 20:30:03	AstralStorm	and the more advanced depends on your irc client
2010-09-10 20:30:17	Keshl	Oh, I thought you meant stuff that was said before I came into the room.
2010-09-10 20:30:28	silasdavis	xchat logs to disk by default I believe
2010-09-10 20:30:29	@lythandrel	Keshl: if you're using kvirc, or konversation or xchat... you play with the scrollbar.
2010-09-10 20:30:40	Keshl	Using Konversation here.
2010-09-10 20:30:49	@lythandrel	Keshl: for stuff said before you came into the room, you'd have to leave yourself idling and not leave the room.
2010-09-10 20:30:57	AstralStorm	silasdavis: no, you have to mark the checkbox
2010-09-10 20:31:05	Keshl	Ah. Okay, my bad, just confusion then.
2010-09-10 20:31:27	AstralStorm	anyway

2010-09-10 20:56:01	vsTerminus	:o
2010-09-10 20:57:56	Keshl	Okay, I'm gunna stop being stupid for the moment and attempt to use common sense. If, when I blacklist the nvidia driver, and everything brakes, I can just use a live CD to remove the listing and it'll be fine, right?
2010-09-10 20:58:47	vsTerminus	breaks*
2010-09-10 20:59:14	vsTerminus	You won't even need a live CD
2010-09-10 20:59:20	vsTerminus	The nvidia driver won't stop you from booting the system
2010-09-10 20:59:37	vsTerminus	You'll still be able to boot up and use a terminal
2010-09-10 21:00:26	vsTerminus	The module is loaded by X, if I'm not mistaken
2010-09-10 21:00:34	Keshl	That's what you think. If, say, my entire X server brakes, I'd have to use the "nox" option to boot. Well, I tried that and blackscreened.
2010-09-10 21:00:40	vsTerminus	breaks*
2010-09-10 21:00:57	Keshl	Then again, I never did ctrl ctrl + alt + f1..
2010-09-10 21:00:57	vsTerminus	If your X server breaks, when it tries to stat you'll just be left with a flashing cursor
2010-09-10 21:01:03	vsTerminus	Press ctrl+alt+F1
2010-09-10 21:01:07	Keshl	I didn't even get that, though.
2010-09-10 21:01:09	vsTerminus	That brings you to a login

2010-09-10 21:04:16	vsTerminus	Well then
2010-09-10 21:04:23	vsTerminus	You could try changing your default runlevel

2010-09-10 21:05:03	Keshl	...Thank you, Shinigami-Sama <.<
2010-09-10 21:05:06	vsTerminus	lol
2010-09-10 21:05:12	Shinigami-Sama	sounds like you forgot to reinstall the drivers after kernel upgrade
2010-09-10 21:05:19	Keshl	No, they're fine right now.
2010-09-10 21:05:26	Keshl	I'm just talking about what happens when I do "nox".
2010-09-10 21:05:54	Shinigami-Sama	anyways reboot time
2010-09-10 21:06:03	Shinigami-Sama	network took a  shit and wont recover
2010-09-10 21:06:06	Keshl	Ditto <.<.. More or less.
2010-09-10 21:06:46	Keshl	So I just change "blacklist nouveau" to "blacklist nvidia"? And when things epicially fail I boot back off the live CD and change it back?
2010-09-10 21:07:15	vsTerminus	Always an option
2010-09-10 21:07:47	Keshl	Okay then. I'll see if that fixes stuff. (By the way, vsTerminus, if you didn't read earlier, the issue is present in KDE too. It's not Compiz's fault, hence why I'm trying nouveau.)

2010-09-11 01:17:01	Keshl	Radtoo: Dumb question time. I've never been able to understand this, what's a "regex"?
2010-09-11 01:17:39	Radtoo	Keshl: A "regular expression". Basically a way to match (and possibly manipulate) text strings.
2010-09-11 01:18:22	Keshl	Radtoo: That's what everything on Google told me a year ago, it's like looking up "Whipped Creme" in a distonary and egtting "Crepe that is whipped" back. x.x
2010-09-11 01:18:26	Keshl	*getting, creme
2010-09-11 01:19:14	Radtoo	Keshl: Well, it allows you to do things with "everything ending with one or more number and then .7z" or such
2010-09-11 01:20:22	Keshl	Radtoo: So, basiclly strings with wildcards?
2010-09-11 01:21:10	Radtoo	Keshl: Or "everything containing the word stupid". Or "Radtoo followed by anything with "gwenview" followed by something again" - that might be useful to figure out when I talked about gwenview in your logs.
2010-09-11 01:21:34	Radtoo	Keshl: Yes. Wildcards. Character classes. Matching groups... all some part of regex dialects.
2010-09-11 01:23:00	Keshl	Radtoo: I think I get it now.. but then why is there a checkbox saying "Use regex expressions" in some text boxes? That confuses me a lot.

2010-09-11 01:23:55	Radtoo	Keshl: Because if you don't have it checked, I bet [1-9] will be applied literally as written, rather than serving as regex for "1" or "2" etc ... or "9"
2010-09-11 01:24:11	Radtoo	Keshl: But it will depend on where you see that checkbox
2010-09-11 01:24:22	Keshl	Radtoo: So "1" and "2" are functions in Regex, at least in some programs?
2010-09-11 01:24:28	Keshl	1-9*
2010-09-11 01:25:20	Radtoo	Keshl: Yes. Well usually it's [1-9] ... with the square brackets.
2010-09-11 01:25:39	Keshl	Radtoo: ohhhhh! Okay, now things make sense!
2010-09-11 01:26:09	Radtoo	Keshl: there's often also [a-Z] or [A-Z] and other character class thingies (hehe, capital or not matters quite often :P)
2010-09-11 01:26:50	Radtoo	Keshl: Well, they are VERY useful if you script or program - even some things you might want to do on bash with just a single command. Or irc /ignore regex. :p
2010-09-11 01:27:49	Keshl	Radtoo: I can definitly see where this would come in handy.. Simple concept to, I'm amazed it took me this long to begin grasping the concept <.<'
2010-09-11 01:28:29	Radtoo	Keshl: Believe me, the nuances in the regex dialects might get you for quite a while even after you theoretically understand "everything". :p
2010-09-11 01:29:14	Enlik	By the way, if you open manual (man <something>), or less, or vim, it searches by regexes :P But sometimes it would be useful to turn it off for a single search - for man for example - don't know if it's possible...
2010-09-11 01:29:40	Enlik	*useful for me, so if anyone knows...
2010-09-11 01:29:55	Radtoo	Enlik: I'm not entirely sure what you mean? Example?
2010-09-11 01:30:30	Keshl	Enlik: COmplete guess here, type "man /pathtofile". I was reading the manual on the manual today, said something that that'll kepe it from searching.
2010-09-11 01:30:40	Keshl	*keep
2010-09-11 01:30:59	Enlik	Radtoo: I'm in manual (man XXX) and I want to search something literally - not by regex. /string searches by regex, sometimes I prefer not...
2010-09-11 01:31:17	Radtoo	Ah. inside the man page. Not like "man bas*" :p
2010-09-11 01:31:37	Enlik	Yes, inside a man page ;]
2010-09-11 01:31:54	Radtoo	Well, how the program searches is usually determined by what you use as $PAGER in the first place

2010-09-11 02:05:17	Radtoo	Yup, primarily you edit /etc/grub.d/ and /etc/default/grub with grub2
2010-09-11 02:06:25	Radtoo	Its not that difficult. A bunch of detection & replacement, plus some static text - that's all there really is to it. :)

2010-09-11 02:26:51	Radtoo	Keshl: don't know, but I think it was an alias for "grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg" anyhow
2010-09-11 02:26:55	Keshl	Enlik: I'm asking because it's not installed.
2010-09-11 02:26:58	genfool	update-grub is not a sabayon/gentoo command
2010-09-11 02:27:19	Keshl	What should I use, then?
2010-09-11 02:27:42	genfool	"grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg"
2010-09-11 02:27:48	Keshl	genfool: Thanks.
2010-09-11 02:28:06	Radtoo	Keshl: if you want it, put the alias in your ~/.bashrc

2010-09-11 02:28:30	Radtoo	Keshl: Or more precisely, root's ~/.bashrc.
2010-09-11 02:29:08	Keshl	Okay, really, last question now. First I thought this was a typo but it's appearing all over this tutorial.. It keeps refering to two tools named "update-grub". Both have an identical name. Why do they keep saying "When "update-grub" or "update-grub" is executed..." and such throughout the page?
2010-09-11 02:29:10	Radtoo	Keshl: alias update-grub='grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg'   <- that should work, I think :p
2010-09-11 02:29:30	Radtoo	Which tutorial?
2010-09-11 02:29:57	Keshl	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275    Yes, I know, I'm not running Ubuntu. <.<

2010-09-11 03:17:12	dave_64	nabin_raj: 5.0?   it's over one year old.  but you can upgrade to 5.3 from there.  it might be easier to download and install 5.3, but upgrading will work

2010-09-11 03:31:09	Keshl	nabin_raj: Do you want me to partition your hard drive for you? A "partition", in a nuthsell, is a virtual hard drive. Youi'll need a second one if you want to install *both* windows and Linux at once, and to prevent data loss on Windows. I used to offer tech support for windows all day, you can download and run one program and I can handle the rest. In fact, the program's found in Sabayon, now that I think of it..

2010-09-11 03:34:34	nabin_raj	keshl: thanks
2010-09-11 03:34:38	Keshl	nabin_raj: But you'll want at least 64 gigs of space for Sabayon, if you'll use it as a primary system (Rather than a "just for kicks" thing.). Do you know how big Ubuntu's partition is?
2010-09-11 03:34:54	nabin_raj	keshl: so how do i go about installing sabayon in my laptop
2010-09-11 03:35:17	Radtoo	Keshl: how do you end up with 64gb?
2010-09-11 03:35:21	nabin_raj	ubuntus partition is about 50gig
2010-09-11 03:35:47	Keshl	Radtoo: The minium recommended space is 20 gigs. At the rate I use my system, that'd last me a year or so. 64 is a multiple of two and would last five years or so.
2010-09-11 03:35:53	nabin_raj	@keshl:anyways all my harddrive is pretty full right now
2010-09-11 03:36:16	Keshl	nabin_raj: That's big enough, I'd say. Do you want to install voer Ubuntu? There's almost no configureation to do, then./
2010-09-11 03:36:18	nabin_raj	so i dont know how i can get space for sabayon
2010-09-11 03:36:25	dave_64	nabin_raj: you probably should be in the channel when you install, if you haven't installed before.   you can get questions answered as you go through the installer

2010-09-11 03:38:41	Keshl	Radtoo: No, I have everything udner /. I emant I have 12 TB of external storage space.
2010-09-11 03:38:56	nabin_raj	@keshl :thanks anyways. but i think that i will just use the live dvd till i get the hang of it
2010-09-11 03:39:13	Keshl	nabin_raj: Okay, that'll work. But you're missing out on the six-ten second boot time, hehe..
2010-09-11 03:40:08	Radtoo	Keshl: Hmm...? some NAS then?
2010-09-11 03:40:15	Keshl	Radtoo: NAS?
2010-09-11 03:40:25	Radtoo	Keshl: Network attached storage.
2010-09-11 03:40:52	Keshl	Radtoo: No. With the infected PC on my LAN I'd never dream of using that. Just standard external drives.
2010-09-11 03:41:10	nabin_raj	keshl: haha, thats alright cause right now with my vista ...i had been keeping up with upto 3 minutes boot time . haha you know let windows boot and get a coffee or something ..read the newspaper! haha
2010-09-11 03:41:15	Radtoo	Keshl: 0_o you have a bunch of disconnected 2TB drives scattered around?
2010-09-11 03:41:43	Keshl	Radtoo: 1.5 TB, actually. GOt thema round the time when 1.5 cost $30 more than 1.0 TB, but 2 TB cost $100 more than 1.5.
2010-09-11 03:42:29	Keshl	nabin_raj: Yeah, I used to be like that. Now my computer turns on when my alarm goes off (Not a Linux feature, my BIOS is just nice) and by the time I'm out of bed I've got a login prompt :)
2010-09-11 03:43:20	Keshl	Radtoo: Although, I do have a few 2 TB's. They've got 3 TB's out too, now. Don't got any of them though.
2010-09-11 03:43:52	nabin_raj	keshl: wow!
2010-09-11 03:44:03	Radtoo	Keshl: hah, missed the introduction of the 3tbs
2010-09-11 03:44:46	Keshl	Radtoo: They're still new, actually. Only Segate makes them right now, I believe.

2010-09-11 03:47:31	Radtoo	Keshl: Sounds mildly interesting, but only if they're as fast and reliable as some WD Caviar black or the like. Even with RAID it's kind of annoying if drives fail...
2010-09-11 03:47:58	Keshl	Radtoo: That's another reason I don't have all 2 TB discs.

2010-09-11 03:49:50	Keshl	Radtoo: But really I just use it because it's 500 gigs less to lose.
2010-09-11 03:50:19	Radtoo	Simply put, you need RAID and possibly a NAS. ;)
2010-09-11 03:50:43	thegreatspace	dave_64: Thanks
2010-09-11 03:51:03	Keshl	Radtoo: NAS is *not* an option for me, since my very ignroant father is also on the same LAN.
2010-09-11 03:51:19	Radtoo	Keshl: And? Whatsitmatter? :p
2010-09-11 03:51:20	Keshl	I would, however, love to have a huge RAID array. But I'd probably sit there just listening to it spin up and down all day <.<..
2010-09-11 03:51:59	Radtoo	Keshl: 'tis not like you can't secure a NAS (which typically runs linux with some web frontend).
2010-09-11 03:52:05	Keshl	Radtoo: The virus arp-poisions the network and tries to get into network shares. Whoever is controlling it actually knows a *lot* about me. He used some of my common passwords on my FTP server once, from an itnernal IP.

2010-09-11 03:54:50	Keshl	Radtoo: Look, the thing's infected his old laptop's BIOS with it. We'd reinstall windows after zeroing the ahrd drive and it'd crop right back up. I don't know what this thing is capeable of, I don't wanna risk it <.<
2010-09-11 03:56:25	Radtoo	That still makes less sense - the network isn't unsafe simply because some horribly secured windows box failed to remain secure. But of course, do whatever you like :p

2010-09-11 04:29:33	dave_64	nabin_raj: you will have a great deal of difficulty getting any good results from installing outside the package manager,  and you can not use the package manager from a livedvd

2010-09-11 04:30:27	dave_64	nabin_raj: from an installed sabayon, you would type: equo install skype

2010-09-11 19:24:17	sabayonweb_93615	What about NetworkManager support for those 2 in GNOME edition?
2010-09-11 19:25:27	Azerthoth	since I avoid gnome like the plague ...

2010-09-11 19:33:17	Azerthoth	portage isnt really recommended if your not intimatly familiar with it already

2010-09-11 19:35:17	Keshl	theadmin: Supports on-the-fly compression, scaled down screens are scaled down on the server side (saves more bandwidth, just a 10% smaller screen makes a huge difference).. and mine's dynamic too. YOur point?

2010-09-11 19:37:28	theadmin	Azerthoth: And that too. But you know... take Ubuntu. You click "Upgrade" in this update manager, it takes you to the next release breaking half of stuff %)
2010-09-11 19:37:41	Keshl	Exactly! That's why I dumped it!
2010-09-11 19:38:07	Keshl	That, and, Gnome got *really* annoying, but, mostly cuz of the upgrade problems.
2010-09-11 19:38:44	Azerthoth	never took to ubuntu, I was a rather experianced Debian user before Ubuntu came out
2010-09-11 19:38:53	theadmin	Well... Ubuntu has made a lot of mess with libnotify, metacity/compiz, and the default app set is no longer making me feel at home right away :(

2010-09-11 19:40:29	Keshl	theadmin: Lucky that's all that broke <.< Try booting through a kernel panic when it can't find the root device, because it can't use USB and it's installed over USB.

2010-09-11 19:56:19	Keshl	Comes with an installer though (Which, for me, bugs out during partitioning if I don't boot fully into Sabayon. If I just hit "install sabayon" at the boot menu, stuff goes VERY bad <.<)

2010-09-11 20:00:29	Keshl	theadmin: What are you asking, exactly? This one's like Ubuntu, I think. Type sudo (command), enter, password, enter.
2010-09-11 20:00:30	@|Cadmus|	sudo[1]: Even though sudo is present on sabayon, we don't advise using it.  Many of our howtos contain chained commands, which sudo will only execute the first portion of with root privileges.  Please use su instead.  If you really want to do things the stupid way, then here's how.  http://wiki.sabayonlinux.org/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Enable_sudo
2010-09-11 20:00:32	@|Cadmus|	sudo[2]: it is also proven that sudo does not update the operating environment properly, this can lead to small but dangerous stability issues at times

2010-09-11 20:02:27	@lythandrel	sudo doesn't updated the environment properly, and doesn't allow for use of chained commands - only the first portion of the chain gets root privilege.

2010-09-11 20:04:45	Azerthoth	that behaviour can be fixed, I have given lxnay the fix several times, just never gets implemented (p.s. gentoo suffers from the same problem)
2010-09-11 20:06:08	theadmin	Say, when does the version number get incremented? id est, sabayon is a rolling release so there's no real version. I guess when developers suddenly make a new ISO considered stable?
2010-09-11 20:06:21	Keshl	Yes, exactly.
2010-09-11 20:06:27	Diddlebug	Very good question theadmin, I was goign to ask the same
2010-09-11 20:06:31	Keshl	They're just snapshots of the nightly builds that seem sufficently stable.
2010-09-11 20:06:59	Diddlebug	Keshl, what determines the incrementation?
2010-09-11 20:07:09	Azerthoth	theadmin, there is versioning, both at the package level and inside the package manager
2010-09-11 20:07:12	Diddlebug	That is, will 5.4 be next or a straight jump to 6?
2010-09-11 20:07:16	Keshl	5.4 is next.
2010-09-11 20:07:19	theadmin	So when does major get incremented, and when does minor?
2010-09-11 20:07:24	Keshl	I have no idea what makes the major jumps.
2010-09-11 20:07:30	theadmin	oh.
2010-09-11 20:07:33	Keshl	But I know, from hanging here enough, that 5.4 is "coming up very soon"
2010-09-11 20:07:37	Diddlebug	new screen art :)
2010-09-11 20:07:48	Azerthoth	major when we have to do major rebase, minor when updates start getting near new iso size
2010-09-11 20:07:53	@lythandrel	theadmin: when there's a major change that requires a ton of new stuff, generally a new python version.
2010-09-11 20:08:08	theadmin	lythandrel: LOVE Python.
2010-09-11 20:08:11	Azerthoth	?? point
2010-09-11 20:08:12	@|Cadmus|	point: the point releases (5.1 .2 .3 etc) are just to cut down on the amount up updates a fresh install requires to be brought up to current and are not needed if you have been doing your updates all along.

2010-09-11 20:12:56	Azerthoth	the difference between being a computer user and an application user
2010-09-11 20:13:07	Diddlebug	arkanabar, are you dual-booting?
2010-09-11 20:13:17	Keshl	Diddlebug: He somehow got it into his head that Norton is good and that if a program says it's not a virus and to turn off the AV, that it can't possible be lying. And he's certain he's right.
2010-09-11 20:13:25	Keshl	*possibly
2010-09-11 20:13:26	arkanabar	triple, actually.  Mint 9, ubuntu 10.04, and sabayon lxde 5.3
2010-09-11 20:13:30	Diddlebug	if so, you should uncheck the daylgiht-savings correction on install
2010-09-11 20:13:38	theadmin	arkanabar: Mint! yum.
2010-09-11 20:13:52	Azerthoth	arkanabar, theadmin thoughts on LMDE?
2010-09-11 20:14:14	Diddlebug	I know that selecting that on install with another OS, can sometimes lead to that.
2010-09-11 20:14:22	arkanabar	lookin forward to it.  ought to be tighter than with the ubuntu base.

2010-09-11 20:17:28	theadmin	Diddlebug: I do, but not with Sabayon (yet), if it's generic I can help
2010-09-11 20:17:37	theadmin	Keshl: Gates uses macs and that's known AFAIK
2010-09-11 20:17:45	Diddlebug	no question in particular, other than what is the correlation between GTK and Gnome
2010-09-11 20:17:58	Keshl	theadmin: I'd laugh, so haaaaard, at a macindows..
2010-09-11 20:18:14	theadmin	Diddlebug: GTK is a thing which draws all your buttons, window scrollbars, other thingies...
2010-09-11 20:18:20	theadmin	Diddlebug: GNOME is, well, a set of apps
2010-09-11 20:18:32	Diddlebug	right, but people seem to say that GTK works best on Gnome
2010-09-11 20:18:42	theadmin	Diddlebug: maybe cause GNOME uses it by default.
2010-09-11 20:19:02	Diddlebug	What does KDE use?
2010-09-11 20:19:06	theadmin	Diddlebug: Qt4
2010-09-11 20:19:13	Diddlebug	Quicktime 4? ;)
2010-09-11 20:19:26	Diddlebug	KDE = ugly :)
2010-09-11 20:19:28	theadmin	Diddlebug: No idea if that acronym even stands for anything.
2010-09-11 20:19:44	Keshl	theadmin: That's interesting to me. Whenever I try to run a qt4 GUI, bad stuff happens. Maybe I really *should* get e17..
2010-09-11 20:19:51	arkanabar	gnome is drawn with Gimp Tool Kit widgets -- that's the most formal description.  Qt is a different widget toolkit.

2010-09-11 20:23:17	arkanabar	i've installed and started ntpd.
2010-09-11 20:23:24	Keshl	arkanabar: Are you dual-booting with windows?
2010-09-11 20:23:44	Diddlebug	Arkanabar, I told you, if you are dual-booting, the daylight-savings correction has to be unchecked.
2010-09-11 20:23:53	Azerthoth	if its ntp is still off, then your time zone is set wrong, or you DE timezone is set wrong
2010-09-11 20:24:00	Keshl	Diddlebug: Actually, it's "system clock uses UTC" that needs to be unchecked.
2010-09-11 20:24:09	Diddlebug	sorry, that's it
2010-09-11 20:24:11	Diddlebug	my bad
2010-09-11 20:24:23	theadmin	Yeah, you normally have to tell it you're on local time when installing

2010-09-11 20:25:38	arkanabar	and just to be sure, I threw away the drive that used to have windows on it.
2010-09-11 20:25:47	Diddlebug	arkanabar, he asked if you have any other OS's installed.
2010-09-11 20:25:51	Diddlebug	you have Mint and Ubuntu
2010-09-11 20:26:12	Diddlebug	Damn, you threw away the drive to be sure?
2010-09-11 20:26:17	Diddlebug	that's hardcore hate.
2010-09-11 20:26:26	Keshl	arkanabar: Okay, when you were installing sabayon and picking the timezone (The thing with a map of the world on it), did you UNcheck "System clock uses UTC"?

2010-09-11 20:31:53	Keshl	theadmin: Better than Spritz ;)
2010-09-11 20:32:04	Diddlebug	arkanabar, as an aside, know that a severely off system clock affects TOR. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get TOR running, and it turns out that if it detects a wrong time, it can't form the connections
2010-09-11 20:32:10	theadmin	I'm just wondering if Sabayon is the right distro to show off to Linux newbies so I need to check friendliness :D
2010-09-11 20:32:19	Keshl	theadmin: It is!
2010-09-11 20:32:34	Diddlebug	theadmin, FOR SURE
2010-09-11 20:32:36	Azerthoth	theadmin, sabayon is a midlevel distro
2010-09-11 20:32:49	Keshl	theadmin: That's my plan too! <.< JUst, seriously, don't get a daily build just because all the people asking for it have DSL. It's NOT worth the trouble. 6 more hours downloading is a lot shorter than months of lag x.x
2010-09-11 20:32:55	Diddlebug	it is so beautiful and OOTB

2010-09-11 20:33:27	theadmin	Azerthoth: Well... so not everything may be done GUIly. But the everyday basic tasks?
2010-09-11 20:33:37	Azerthoth	not as OOB, but very GUIcentric functional
2010-09-11 20:33:38	arkanabar	Azerthoth: how do I start ntp-client?
2010-09-11 20:33:47	Keshl	Diddlebug: I'm gunna say heck no. Never booted right on mine, mouse kept dying (Using serial, not USB), keyboard was picked up as "Arabic" (Seriously)..

2010-09-11 20:34:03	theadmin	^ knew it
2010-09-11 20:34:08	Keshl	theadmin: Yes, MOST tasks can be done, with a GUI.
2010-09-11 20:34:19	Keshl	theadmin: But if you want the best, learn to use SSH and don't tell them the root password <.<
2010-09-11 20:34:26	Keshl	theadmin: No way they'd brake things then.
2010-09-11 20:34:28	Diddlebug	Honestly, OOTB is most important. The less issues that need to be resolved, the less need to resort to command-line
2010-09-11 20:34:42	theadmin	Keshl: Uh well, if I want to hand it over for them to use, on their computer...
2010-09-11 20:35:20	Diddlebug	Theadmin, there's always a worry that an upgrade could break things....
2010-09-11 20:35:20	Keshl	theadmin: The people around me never need root access, all they do is use Open Office anyway (Hence part of my obession with COmpiz. Since they do so little, it's definitly a key "selling" point.).
2010-09-11 20:35:25	theadmin	What's this OOTB thing anyway? First I hear everything is broken and now OOTB!
2010-09-11 20:35:32	Keshl	theadmin: "Out Of the Box"
2010-09-11 20:35:36	Diddlebug	compiz really is beautiful
2010-09-11 20:35:45	seeds	yes ssh is incredible.
2010-09-11 20:35:46	Keshl	Diddlebug: It is.... Except mine hates me. Wanna try to fix mine? =D
2010-09-11 20:35:58	Diddlebug	no thanks... :)
2010-09-11 20:36:01	Diddlebug	what card do you use?
2010-09-11 20:36:04	Diddlebug	what's broken about it?
2010-09-11 20:36:15	theadmin	Compiz... Nah thanks... like Aero on Windows - useless. Altough pretty
2010-09-11 20:36:28	Diddlebug	I would say that Aero is far more intrusive
2010-09-11 20:36:40	Keshl	Diddlebug: nVidia 260 GTX. Every 10-60 minutes it stops redrawing unless I actively move the mouse or type. There is no reason for it to fix its self, but it starts a lot when a tooltip comes up OR when I alt-tab.
2010-09-11 20:36:49	Diddlebug	Every little bell and whistle on Compiz can be turned on and off.
2010-09-11 20:36:52	Keshl	Diddlebug: The issue is present with COmpiz off too, though.
2010-09-11 20:36:56	Diddlebug	I just have wobbly windows and that's it.
2010-09-11 20:36:57	arkanabar	theadmin: sorta how I think of kde:  like a heavy snowfall.  pretty, fun to play with, but after a while, I just want somebody to take it all away.
2010-09-11 20:37:14	Diddlebug	Keshl, have you checked refresh rate?
2010-09-11 20:37:51	Keshl	Diddlebug: That could be the problem now that I think of it... Before the .35 upgrade, it pciked it up at 60 hz (Correct, my screen does 60, 100, 110 and 120). Now it's at 50-53..
2010-09-11 20:37:55	Keshl	*picked
2010-09-11 20:38:08	Diddlebug	theadmin: the window changing effects on compiz, like being able to pull a window to another desktop with a fast pull of the mouse, is amazing and useful
2010-09-11 20:38:15	arkanabar	Azerthoth: do I need now to restart?
2010-09-11 20:38:26	Diddlebug	Keshl, turn off autodetect and push it 100....
2010-09-11 20:38:30	Diddlebug	then restart compiz
2010-09-11 20:38:33	Keshl	Diddlebug: How would I do that?
2010-09-11 20:38:48	theadmin	Diddlebug: Window moving to another desktop is only ever useful for me if I try to hide some stuff I'm doing :P I normally have 2-4 windows open
2010-09-11 20:39:25	Diddlebug	theadmin: right, but my point is that there are useful aspects to Compiz that Aero completely lacks
2010-09-11 20:39:33	Diddlebug	Keshl: go to compiz settings manager
2010-09-11 20:39:38	theadmin	Diddlebug: I'm not saying it's a clone of aero...

2010-09-11 20:43:02	Azerthoth	arkanabar, no need to restart, if you want that to run all the time as root: rc-update add ntp-client default

2010-09-11 20:45:30	Keshl	Diddlebug: but the "output" only has "640x460+0+0", should I change that to my actual resolution? (Did what you said, too.)
2010-09-11 20:45:53	Diddlebug	nahh, that's what mine says....
2010-09-11 20:45:58	Keshl	Diddlebug: Okay.
2010-09-11 20:45:59	Diddlebug	i have 1920x1200 running perfect
2010-09-11 20:46:04	Diddlebug	okay, then hit the back button
2010-09-11 20:46:06	Keshl	Diddlebug: 1680x1050 here.

2010-09-11 20:46:44	Diddlebug	then click reload window manager
2010-09-11 20:46:52	Keshl	Diddlebug: Done.
2010-09-11 20:46:55	Diddlebug	you should see a flicker
2010-09-11 20:46:59	Keshl	Diddlebug: Yes.
2010-09-11 20:47:03	Diddlebug	ok, so your refresh rate is changed.
2010-09-11 20:47:11	Diddlebug	lets hope the redraw issue doesn't happen
2010-09-11 20:47:12	Diddlebug	 :)
2010-09-11 20:47:26	Keshl	Diddlebug: If it really gets fixed, you'll be considered a hero here. <.<
2010-09-11 20:47:42	Diddlebug	you can push refresh rate higher to achieve smoother effects too.
2010-09-11 20:47:50	Diddlebug	but your graphics card will work harder.
2010-09-11 20:47:59	Diddlebug	do you have nVidia-settings installed?
2010-09-11 20:48:05	Keshl	Diddlebug: I hardly use it anyway. The effects beat games hands-down IMO <.< and yes, I do.
2010-09-11 20:48:25	Keshl	Diddlebug: Got it set at maxium preformence because I thought it messed stuff up when it changed. That actually did help a little. When I lag, issues resolve faster now.
2010-09-11 20:48:36	Diddlebug	okay, good...
2010-09-11 20:48:58	Diddlebug	for good measure, always run a google search for something and "gentoo"....
2010-09-11 20:49:22	Diddlebug	as the gentoo forums usually have people who've encountered issues and the community is larger than the sabayon subset
2010-09-11 20:49:24	Keshl	Diddlebug: Like what? And I thought Sabayon wasn't based on Gentoo (Or is, but ios forked so far that it's not anymore)
2010-09-11 20:49:26	Keshl	*is
2010-09-11 20:49:55	Diddlebug	so a search for "260 GTX gentoo" may bring up some pearls of wisdom
2010-09-11 20:50:04	Diddlebug	I found a cure to my audio issue that way.
2010-09-11 20:50:07	Keshl	Diddlebug: Okay, thanks, I can figure that out from there XD
2010-09-11 20:50:13	Diddlebug	:)
2010-09-11 20:50:20	Keshl	Diddlebug: Oh, speaking of audio issues... This one isn't Linux-based, but, I don't get it.
2010-09-11 20:50:29	Diddlebug	Alsa?
2010-09-11 20:51:05	Keshl	Diddlebug: My computer has no headphone port. It only supports surround sound output (Five holes on the back). Can I somehow redirect all audio out one hole and use it as a headphone in Linux? Tried in windows, heard nothing.
2010-09-11 20:51:14	theadmin	Diddlebug: Alsa is Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
2010-09-11 20:51:14	Azerthoth	Keshl, not even forked, sabayon is 99.9% gentoo

2010-09-11 20:54:44	Keshl	arkanabar: How much would one of those cost? Sounds promising..

2010-09-11 21:45:23	theadmin	Diddlebug: Why
2010-09-11 21:45:32	Diddlebug	because i talk back to him
2010-09-11 21:45:35	Azerthoth	I only threaten you
2010-09-11 21:45:35	DHalens	depending of what you want, dev ML may be the place
2010-09-11 21:45:43	Diddlebug	usually he just sets op to threaten me.
2010-09-11 21:45:43	Azerthoth	only kicked once (maybe twice)
2010-09-11 21:45:55	Diddlebug	like putting on gloves
2010-09-11 21:46:04	Diddlebug	:)

2010-09-11 21:48:23	Azerthoth	hey, your the one who got lost at the end :)
2010-09-11 21:48:42	Diddlebug	and then you snubbed me when I went to shake hands
2010-09-11 21:49:21	Diddlebug	shoot, have to run out to the pharmacy. brb
2010-09-11 21:49:58	theadmin	I reaaally hope pulse won't bug out on me in Sabayon - or do we use ALSA?
2010-09-11 21:50:22	Azerthoth	pulse is default, alsa is fallback and available
2010-09-11 21:51:01	Diddlebug	one works in some apps, other in others.
2010-09-11 21:51:05	theadmin	on SUSE, Pulse was a lot wtf - it only played 5 seconds of any audio, then froze for something like 10 secs, and again
2010-09-11 21:51:07	Diddlebug	the audio on linux is pretty retarded
2010-09-11 21:51:25	Diddlebug	just run alsaconfig
2010-09-11 21:51:34	Azerthoth	oss4 holds promise, but it's not there yet
2010-09-11 21:51:35	Diddlebug	and then alsa mixer to setup the audio
2010-09-11 21:51:46	Diddlebug	why can't they have a SIMPLE setup like windows?
2010-09-11 21:51:56	theadmin	oh also - what's the default IM client in Sabayon
2010-09-11 21:51:58	theadmin	?
2010-09-11 21:52:03	Azerthoth	there isnt one
2010-09-11 21:52:12	Diddlebug	use Empathy or Pidgin
2010-09-11 21:52:26	theadmin	Pidgin. I'll go with that.
2010-09-11 21:52:32	theadmin	So no preinstalled one? That's quite rare
2010-09-11 21:52:45	Diddlebug	I wish there was less preinstalled.
2010-09-11 21:53:07	theadmin	Diddlebug: Hm... what stuff should be removed in your opinion? Some distros are overloaded
2010-09-11 21:53:15	Diddlebug	Totem
2010-09-11 21:53:27	Diddlebug	Should have VLC as default
2010-09-11 21:53:40	theadmin	Diddlebug: No idea why they don' like VLC - it rocks the hell out
2010-09-11 21:53:55	Azerthoth	VLC has issues
2010-09-11 21:53:55	DHalens	vlc sucks!
2010-09-11 21:54:04	Diddlebug	vlc sucks?
2010-09-11 21:54:06	theadmin	Azerthoth: issues?
2010-09-11 21:54:06	Diddlebug	are you nuts?
2010-09-11 21:54:12	Azerthoth	its buggy as hell if you want to do anything other than playback
2010-09-11 21:54:17	theadmin	Hey guys NO flamewars
2010-09-11 21:54:28	theadmin	Azerthoth: ...what _else_ must a player do apart from playback?
2010-09-11 21:54:32	DHalens	mplayer based players have better subs support
2010-09-11 21:54:46	theadmin	DHalens: Anime fan or something? ;)
2010-09-11 21:54:56	Diddlebug	VLC's codec compatibiloty is legendary
2010-09-11 21:55:01	Azerthoth	theadmin, video capture / playback is bugged, as is output streaming
2010-09-11 21:55:08	Diddlebug	DHalens fan subs stuff for himself.
2010-09-11 21:55:10	DHalens	theadmin: lets leave it in something
2010-09-11 21:55:35	theadmin	Azerthoth: I dunno. Well, doesn't stop me from using it - especially considering that repos have the latest

2010-09-11 21:55:48	Diddlebug	I like Exhaile better
2010-09-11 21:55:50	Azerthoth	VLC and a TV card using either v4l or v4l2 is a nightmare with VLC, mencoder/mplayer handle it wonderfully

2010-09-11 21:57:57	Diddlebug	I don't think its packaged that way

2010-09-11 21:58:07	Azerthoth	need to rig one of my systems up with wine
2010-09-11 21:58:17	Diddlebug	Crossover Linux is nice
2010-09-11 21:58:45	Diddlebug	I'd take out Evolution
2010-09-11 21:58:47	theadmin	Diddlebug: Well, I can never be sure
2010-09-11 21:59:01	theadmin	Diddlebug: Evolution is, again, one of common apps for any GNOME distro
2010-09-11 21:59:27	Diddlebug	right, but its not as good as Thunderbird....I guess if someone uses calender integration, but who would with Evolution?
2010-09-11 21:59:30	Azerthoth	wine-doors, play-on-linux, cedega, all similar to crossover
2010-09-11 21:59:50	Diddlebug	Crossover feels very polished, but I'm sure the others are good too.
2010-09-11 22:00:17	Diddlebug	Clementine is so much better than Audacious
2010-09-11 22:00:19	Azerthoth	I just stick with wine, I'm simple like that

2010-09-11 23:28:06	Keshl	Azerthoth: It's not even half eaten. The amount of completed projects done by apple is directly related to how far that apple has been eaten.

2010-09-12 01:12:20	Keshl	theadmin: Oh, okay.
2010-09-12 01:12:33	theadmin	Hm. The install guide says to update the installer before installing... that's one weird step
2010-09-12 01:12:52	Keshl	theadmin: Don't.
2010-09-12 01:12:58	Keshl	theadmin: Just... Don't.
2010-09-12 01:13:06	theadmin	Don't what?
2010-09-12 01:13:12	theadmin	Don't not upgrade or don't upgrade?
2010-09-12 01:13:13	Keshl	theadmin: Same rule as a nightly build applies there (And, you can't update it anyway, I think.)
2010-09-12 01:13:38	theadmin	Why does the guide say so :/
2010-09-12 01:13:40	Keshl	theadmin: Don't update it. On my systems, whenever it did, partitioning crashed. It never wrote anything, but it scares me.
2010-09-12 01:14:03	Keshl	theadmin: It's outdated. There's not a button to upgrade it anymore. Well, you could Equo it, but... I still don't trust it.
2010-09-12 01:14:12	Keshl	theadmin: I'd ask someone else here who used a sane ISO <.<
2010-09-12 01:14:23	Keshl	theadmin: But from my personal experiences, I know updateing brings bad things.
2010-09-12 01:14:41	theadmin	Updating of anything? o_O
2010-09-12 01:14:57	theadmin	So no button. means I don't have to do it :D
2010-09-12 01:15:23	Keshl	theadmin: Updateing the *installer* only.
2010-09-12 01:15:36	theadmin	Keshl: Phew. You scared me for a second.
2010-09-12 01:15:38	Keshl	theadmin: older releases of it had a big giant "UPDATE INSTALLER" button at the bottom that you could click.
2010-09-12 01:15:46	Keshl	theadmin: Newer ones don't. I think.
2010-09-12 01:16:27	theadmin	http://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=Visual_Tour:_Installing_Sabayon_Linux_Gnome Well yeah. I see it here as you see. Probably since it was removed it's a bad thing
2010-09-12 01:16:48	Keshl	theadmin: That's for 4.x
2010-09-12 01:17:06	Keshl	theadmin: I really wouldn't follow that... I'd just stay in IRC and get someone to talk you through it.

2010-09-12 03:59:22	Keshl	And I mean it <.<
2010-09-12 04:00:11	Keshl	So, in Grub, there's a paramater in Sabayon "vga=791". Is there a code I can type to make it 1680x1050, so I don't ahve to wait for my monitor to change to that when the login screen comes up? it'd save me 3-4 seconds per boot.

2010-09-12 04:08:54	Azerthoth	as that starts up before the video drivers engage

2010-09-12 04:09:13	Keshl	My monitor its self, not my compute,r monitor, takes forever to actually switch resolutions.
2010-09-12 04:09:37	Keshl	When my computer starts, the BIOS and such is at 480x320, then it goes a bit higher in Grub2's menu, then a bit higher when Sabayon begins to boot.
2010-09-12 04:09:43	Keshl	And then finally, higher, when the login comes up.
2010-09-12 04:09:43	Azerthoth	thats after splash, vga settings are meaningless, they have nothing to do with the video engaging
2010-09-12 04:09:58	Azerthoth	so there is splash
2010-09-12 04:10:08	Azerthoth	you get the prettyies during boot up
2010-09-12 04:10:22	Keshl	Splash, to me, says "loading". I don't see that until *after* the login promp.t Resolution is set before then.
2010-09-12 04:11:12	Azerthoth	do you have a black screen prior to splash, with all the module loads and system inits showing?
2010-09-12 04:11:52	Keshl	How can it be black and show stuff at the same time?
2010-09-12 04:12:07	Azerthoth	*sigh*
2010-09-12 04:12:13	Azerthoth	if you saw it you would know
2010-09-12 04:12:17	Azerthoth	so you do have splash
2010-09-12 04:12:18	Keshl	Azerthoth: Okay, sorry for beiung dumb. I just won't ask you anymore.
2010-09-12 04:12:21	Keshl	*being

2010-09-12 05:35:39	theadmin	nautilus-dropbox is not fully opensource (requires to install a propertiary daemon)

2010-09-12 05:36:43	theadmin	Can as well submit a package request for TeamViewer then, if the tarball from their site requires messing
2010-09-12 05:37:13	Keshl	theadmin: I really don't see why you'd want TeamViewer. You're already learning a new OS, why not try programs with better reputation while you're at it, too?
2010-09-12 05:37:36	theadmin	Keshl: You know, some things you like and stick to them, some you throw away
2010-09-12 05:38:09	theadmin	Keshl: I want to throw Ubuntu-based distros in the wastebin since it's just slow and... feels like they have a registry hidden somewhere in it, cause it gets slower with time
2010-09-12 05:38:38	Keshl	theadmin: But have you even tried TightVNC? Using it is even easier than you can possible imagine.. If someone wants to see your screen then they just go to one webpage and run Java. No accounts required on either side. If you wanna see theirs, send them one single .exe and have them run it. No install, still no config, and it's just right there.
2010-09-12 05:39:05	theadmin	Keshl: .exe huh? Running a remote control app trough WINE Is mad %)
2010-09-12 05:39:26	Keshl	theadmin: Are you trying to give help to people who already have Linux, or people on windows?
2010-09-12 05:39:30	theadmin	...altough that's what TV does %)
2010-09-12 05:39:33	theadmin	Keshl: Both.
2010-09-12 05:39:43	Keshl	theadmin: Windows, do what I said. Wine, look up "krdp"
2010-09-12 05:39:47	Keshl	er, linux*
2010-09-12 05:40:16	theadmin	...well... krdp is the rdp client for KDE... so what.
2010-09-12 05:40:20	theadmin	Worked with it... messy
2010-09-12 05:40:28	Keshl	theadmin: and even then, you can still do it in Linux. Just make them "equo install tightvnc" then "tightvnc --connect (your IP here)"
2010-09-12 05:40:42	theadmin	TeamViewer is something even my granny can use you see :D She doesn't know what an IP is I think
2010-09-12 05:41:09	Keshl	theadmin: At least try it.
2010-09-12 05:41:26	theadmin	Keshl: I will, allright, when I get my hands onto my box and install Sabayon
2010-09-12 05:41:44	Keshl	theadmin: Thank you. x.x
2010-09-12 05:41:56	theadmin	Keshl: What's with the teamviewer hate anyway %)
2010-09-12 05:42:45	Keshl	theadmin: I've heard people say it has a real backdoor in it, but that it's such a good piece of software that people still use it knowing full well they're opening themselves up.
2010-09-12 05:43:24	theadmin	Keshl: A backdoor huh... well, as long as I don't run it as root that's not much to worry about for me. And, it's probably fixed by now anyway %)
2010-09-12 05:44:02	Keshl	theadmin: Both sides, not just yours, would be infected..
2010-09-12 05:44:07	theadmin	Actually I still can't figure what's with the weird username (root)
2010-09-12 05:44:10	Keshl	theadmin: Don't wanna cause more problems than you solve.
2010-09-12 05:44:25	Keshl	theadmin: "root", the "root of everything", derives from "root of all evil" "root of all good", etc.
2010-09-12 05:44:33	theadmin	Keshl: I see.
2010-09-12 05:44:44	theadmin	Keshl: "admin" would make oh-so-much-more sense

2010-09-12 05:44:55	theadmin	Keshl: o_O wha
2010-09-12 05:44:56	Keshl	theadmin: That's why the commands are "funny".
2010-09-12 05:45:13	Keshl	theadmin: Windows actually copyrighted a LOT of stuff just to try to keep other companies from competeing.
2010-09-12 05:45:20	theadmin	Keshl: I never found anything funny in commands except maybe "fsck"
2010-09-12 05:45:38	Keshl	theadmin: They though people would need to use odd commands (like "askdasfgh") to do simple tasks. Genius thought, but then people grew common sense.
2010-09-12 05:46:16	Keshl	theadmin: The only "weird" ones I've come across are "cat" "fsck" "touch" "finger" "probe" (sometimes, anyway) and.. Gah forgot the last one.
2010-09-12 05:46:42	Keshl	theadmin: But, that's why "dir" is 'ls', "admin" is 'root', and so on.
2010-09-12 05:47:06	theadmin	Keshl: Actually, "dir" works on many distros and usually is just an alias of "ls -a"

2010-09-12 09:07:58	Radtoo	No, you manage /etc...
2010-09-12 09:08:35	theadmin	Radtoo: Pretty confusing, then. But will figure - besides configs are usually small
2010-09-12 09:08:37	Radtoo	You get sample configs / preconfigured ones, but updates / removals are your job, mainly.
2010-09-12 09:08:44	Radtoo	why is it confusing?
2010-09-12 09:09:48	theadmin	Radtoo: How am I to know where something puts a config? Sure, I know it for packages I mess with - but not some default sabayon ones e.g. totem which I'll remove right away
2010-09-12 09:09:58	Radtoo	Unused config files don't do you harm. Accidentially removed ones do.
2010-09-12 09:10:04	Radtoo	that's not at all the problem.

2010-09-12 09:10:48	Radtoo	You can query where packages have their files (if any) and you can read / know where applications have configs. besides there's a fairly clear filesystem layout... you should be able to guess where configs can be.
2010-09-12 09:11:03	Radtoo	(FHS has the specification where things are by default...)
2010-09-12 09:12:10	Radtoo	*read on the 'net where applications have configs*, that is
2010-09-12 09:12:29	theadmin	Yeah, sure... configs are in /etc. But some package may put it somewhere into /usr/local/ or /opt... %)
2010-09-12 09:12:42	Radtoo	No, they don't just do that for fun.
2010-09-12 09:13:03	theadmin	But, well, those are easy to track since /usr/local and /opt are usually nearly empty
2010-09-12 09:13:13	Radtoo	... that's just bogus.
2010-09-12 09:13:33	Radtoo	/usr/local is the directory where YOU install things, the packgage manager precisely does NOT use it.
2010-09-12 09:13:55	Radtoo	And /opt is for binary-only packages.
2010-09-12 09:14:14	theadmin	Radtoo: I see... hmmm... I _do_ recall some package from Ubuntu's repos using /usr/local - but Ubuntu is a mess in general
2010-09-12 09:14:23	sabayonweb_39051	radtoo: kdemeta did the trick..  something else.....i reinstalled dolphin and worker and krusader but everytime i use F2 to rename a file in dolphin i get funny colors in the window like this http://recovery1.startlogic.com/images/advert1/sab_photo.jpg where its circled in red.   is there a dolphin fix or something a bit more intuitive than worker to install, when krusader is installed it dosnt spawn.
2010-09-12 09:14:31	Radtoo	3rd party thingies etc. which cannot really be trusted to do one thing or the other reliably. :p
2010-09-12 09:14:57	theadmin	Radtoo: third party thingies in official repos :P weird. But may be.
2010-09-12 09:16:04	theadmin	Radtoo: Also, Mint has a bunch of stuff in /usr/local by default %) But I guess Sabayon does not mess it if you say so

2010-09-12 11:20:26	Keshl	Yeah, I'm gunna have to agree with theadmin.. ATI and Linux have issues with each other. Grab an nVidia and rejoice.
2010-09-12 11:20:44	sabayonweb_34289	its a notebook...
2010-09-12 11:21:04	theadmin	But DON'T grab nVidia network cards. Those hardly work at all (at least with Ubuntu...)

2010-09-12 11:21:55	sabayonweb_34289	what i find very strange is that there is no xorg.conf file
2010-09-12 11:22:05	theadmin	sabayonweb_34289: And I'm new to Sabayon here... actually, check ati.com for drivers, they _may_ be available on Linux for some products

2010-09-12 11:22:32	theadmin	sabayonweb_34289: ...Xorg has auto-configurations hard-coded or something now, xorg.conf can be created for manual configs if you need it.
2010-09-12 11:22:37	Keshl	Either ask Radtoo, genfool or joost_op when they're around, because I have general idea of what you need to do, I just don't know if it's safe to do with ATI.
2010-09-12 11:22:53	sabayonweb_34289	but when i use aticonfig it say no suitable adapter found....

2010-09-12 11:39:42	SigHunter	Привет then?

2010-09-12 11:40:22	SigHunter	:D
2010-09-12 11:43:00	SigHunter	when i tested sabayon in an vm, it automatically encrypted my drive, what encryption does it use?
2010-09-12 11:43:13	SigHunter	or is it just
2010-09-12 11:43:15	SigHunter	passworded?
2010-09-12 11:43:44	theadmin	SigHunter: I think it's just LVM...
2010-09-12 11:44:59	SigHunter	never used lvm before, what does it do?
2010-09-12 11:45:06	SigHunter	just spanning over multiple drives?
2010-09-12 11:45:14	theadmin	SigHunter: I never used it either :D No idea
2010-09-12 11:45:19	SigHunter	kk perfect
2010-09-12 11:45:46	theadmin	But I heavily doubt it'd SUDDENLY encrypt the device - that'd render data unrescuable if you frack up

2010-09-12 13:32:54	scummos	probably my system is a bit...screwed, i guess
2010-09-12 13:33:14	scummos	equo tells me it's on branch 5, what exactly does this imply?
2010-09-12 13:33:30	joost_op	scummos: cat /etc/sabayon-edition
2010-09-12 13:33:52	scummos	Sabayon Linux 5.0 x86 K <- okay
2010-09-12 13:34:12	joost_op	It will tell you what base you used to install Sabayon
2010-09-12 13:34:13	scummos	can i upgrade to 5.3? i'd like to have kdelibs-4.5 and kdebase-4.5
2010-09-12 13:34:29	joost_op	if you installed all updates you are close to having Sabayon 5.4
2010-09-12 13:34:45	scummos	okay, cool
2010-09-12 13:34:51	joost_op	KDE 4.5 is not in the main repositories yet
2010-09-12 13:34:53	scummos	i didn't install *all* updates, but most
2010-09-12 13:34:55	scummos	ah, i see
2010-09-12 13:35:04	joost_op	it is in the testing repo for good reasons
2010-09-12 13:35:20	scummos	:] okay
2010-09-12 13:35:38	joost_op	then there is no need to do anything special
2010-09-12 13:36:09	joost_op	Since Sabayon 5 we kinda decided to keep things "rolling"
2010-09-12 13:36:15	scummos	i'd need kate-4.5 libraries for development... but i guess i'll compile them myself
2010-09-12 13:36:18	scummos	okay, that's cool
2010-09-12 13:36:23	scummos	rolling release cycles are the best :]
2010-09-12 13:36:36	joost_op	Due to this, I advice to keep up with updates a bit
2010-09-12 13:36:51	joost_op	1 month not updating would mean like a huge list off updates
2010-09-12 13:36:53	scummos	ok, thanks

2010-09-12 13:37:27	scummos	mh, 103 packages could be upgraded
2010-09-12 13:37:28	scummos	sounds okay
2010-09-12 13:37:41	joost_op	scummos: Since your initial install was kinda old..
2010-09-12 13:37:57	joost_op	it would mean that entropy in time downloaded allot off updates
2010-09-12 13:38:16	joost_op	you can cleanup all those downloaded packages using equo cleanup
2010-09-12 13:38:24	theadmin	Just wondering - are daily builds done manually by a human or by some scripty?
2010-09-12 13:38:35	scummos	i'm doing equo cleanup regularily, because i made my root partition too small again
2010-09-12 13:38:35	joost_op	and freeup perhaps 4+ gigs
2010-09-12 13:38:44	joost_op	df -h
2010-09-12 13:38:47	joost_op	equo cleanup
2010-09-12 13:38:52	joost_op	df -h again
2010-09-12 13:39:23	scummos	i'm running it almost after every operation i do with equo, because i really need the space
2010-09-12 13:39:52	joost_op	by the droids
2010-09-12 13:40:19	joost_op	theadmin: it works like this
2010-09-12 13:40:32	theadmin	Hm. Will 40GB suffice for a root partition in Sabayon, really? Works fine for most other distros.
2010-09-12 13:41:01	joost_op	take the Spinbase iso -> update it with entropy -> work down a list to install -> do some additional tasks -> create a new iso
2010-09-12 13:41:03	theadmin	But since Sabayon is radically different...
2010-09-12 13:41:13	joost_op	it means that all things are based in Spinbase here
2010-09-12 13:41:37	joost_op	using our own tool (molecule) to change the iso
2010-09-12 13:42:03	joost_op	theadmin: We offer allot more
2010-09-12 13:42:22	joost_op	out off the box git,svn,etc needed to support portage out off the box
2010-09-12 13:42:41	theadmin	joost_op: Well it says 20GB is recommended. What's the minimal actually?
2010-09-12 13:43:07	joost_op	I'd preserve like 2 GIG for keeping the system updated
2010-09-12 13:43:09	joost_op	minimal
2010-09-12 13:43:27	theadmin	I see. Well, I can't honestly provide more than 40GB for rootfs
2010-09-12 13:43:30	joost_op	yeah 20 gig would be enough
2010-09-12 13:43:47	scummos	i have 23
2010-09-12 13:43:50	scummos	and it's full all the time :D
2010-09-12 13:43:52	joost_op	but if you install a game like nexuiz or something

2010-09-12 13:43:59	scummos	so i'd really recommend more
2010-09-12 13:44:07	joost_op	realise you need like 3 gig free space to download and install that
2010-09-12 13:44:23	theadmin	scummos: Full... do you have any additional massive data (e.g. movies)?
2010-09-12 13:44:37	joost_op	its not that our binaries are bigger or something
2010-09-12 13:44:46	joost_op	but we offer just allot more out off the box
2010-09-12 13:44:51	joost_op	A fair deal
2010-09-12 13:44:51	scummos	mh, i'd need to scan my home directory, but most of my data is on a seperate partition
2010-09-12 13:46:06	theadmin	What kind of a distro it is that it needs more than 20 gigs -_- I mean, that's not Windows...
2010-09-12 13:46:22	scummos	i've got a lot of stuff installed...

2010-09-12 20:58:16	jinxx	(originally running sabayon 5.1)
2010-09-12 20:58:31	Keshl	What build, exactly? (Typing "cat /etc/sabayon-edition" in a terminal will bring that up.)
2010-09-12 20:59:28	jinxx	Sabayon Linux 5.3 x86 G
2010-09-12 21:00:21	jinxx	My bootloader is configured to select kernel version 2.6.34 by default, should I change it to select a different version? (ubuntu kept removing sabayon from the bootloader configuration so I had to add it manually)

2010-09-12 21:01:24	jinxx	I'm not sure what ubuntu was doing, but every time it updated the grub bootloader it would remove sabayon
2010-09-12 21:01:39	Keshl	Oh, that's normal.

2010-09-12 21:07:33	Keshl	Or is it just the most recently released set that did this?
2010-09-12 21:07:58	jinxx	the updates probably came within the last week

2010-09-12 21:09:43	Keshl	I just wanna make sure, you didn't, like, have a clean install of 5.1 then suddenly go "Oh, I should probably start updateing all this stuff", since that might brake things if it's far back enough.
2010-09-12 21:09:55	jinxx	I installed 5.1 in late august, kept up with them pretty well after that, then updated about a week ago, then I didn't have time to update again until today

2010-09-12 21:31:51	Keshl	John35: Grab a USB hub, they cost maybe $20-$40, and stick it in the back, and put the case on top of your computer. Simplest solution there is if you don't wanna tinker with the actual wiring.

2010-09-26 23:39:52	@|Cadmus|	wicd: First, make sure wicd is installed, then as root perform the following: 'rc-update add wicd default ; rc-update del NetworkManager ; /etc/init.d/NetworkManager stop ; /etc/init.d/wicd start' then as normal user you can start wicd-client to connect. It is recommended to add wicd-client to autostart as handled by your desktop environment
2010-09-26 23:40:16	Azerthoth|D	qwebirc256287, you will need to `equo update && equo install wicd`
2010-09-26 23:40:20	Azerthoth|D	first

2010-09-26 23:42:20	Azerthoth|D	thats a statement not a question
2010-09-26 23:42:35	qwebirc256287	my question is: WHY?
2010-09-26 23:42:57	qwebirc256287	Am I forgetting something to do before trying to connect?
2010-09-26 23:42:59	Azerthoth|D	have you followed all the steps listed?
2010-09-26 23:43:31	Azerthoth|D	if you have not shut off NetworkManager then you will have issues as both subsytems will be arguing for control of the device

2010-09-27 07:59:15	alemani	no success...
