2010-08-18 18:22:15	egan	Hey, I'm looking to add/change the default terminal keybinding from M-S-Enter to M-x (I use additionalKeysP from EZconfig). I have tried adding a binding for "spawn $ XMonad.terminal conf" which I see on the web, but I get an error about conf not being in the scope. What am I missing?
2010-08-18 18:25:28	allbery_b	conf is available if you use the old style key setting, not with EZConfig
2010-08-18 18:25:45	egan	I see, so what would the proper line be?
2010-08-18 18:27:15	geheimdienst	i guess you can just say: spawn "xterm"
2010-08-18 18:27:19	allbery_b	I think you need to break the terminal definition out so you can reference it
2010-08-18 18:27:21	geheimdienst	or whatever you use for terminals
2010-08-18 18:27:51	geheimdienst	i mean, it's not gonna change so often that you absolutely need it to be in only one place
2010-08-18 18:28:15	egan	I suppose. I guess I kinda wanted to know how to do it "correctly".
2010-08-18 18:28:26	geheimdienst	;-)
2010-08-18 18:28:50	geheimdienst	i guess "correctly" would be myTerminal = "xterm" and then later in your binding: spawn myTerminal
2010-08-18 18:29:03	geheimdienst	and in the main config, terminal = myTerminal
2010-08-18 18:29:13	allbery_b	yes
2010-08-18 18:29:24	geheimdienst	i.e. make a top-level variable and reference it from everywhere you need it
