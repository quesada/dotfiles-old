2010-08-18 18:22:15	egan	Hey, I'm looking to add/change the default terminal keybinding from M-S-Enter to M-x (I use additionalKeysP from EZconfig). I have tried adding a binding for "spawn $ XMonad.terminal conf" which I see on the web, but I get an error about conf not being in the scope. What am I missing?
2010-08-18 18:25:28	allbery_b	conf is available if you use the old style key setting, not with EZConfig
2010-08-18 18:25:45	egan	I see, so what would the proper line be?
2010-08-18 18:27:15	geheimdienst	i guess you can just say: spawn "xterm"
2010-08-18 18:27:19	allbery_b	I think you need to break the terminal definition out so you can reference it
2010-08-18 18:27:21	geheimdienst	or whatever you use for terminals
2010-08-18 18:27:51	geheimdienst	i mean, it's not gonna change so often that you absolutely need it to be in only one place
2010-08-18 18:28:15	egan	I suppose. I guess I kinda wanted to know how to do it "correctly".
2010-08-18 18:28:26	geheimdienst	;-)
2010-08-18 18:28:50	geheimdienst	i guess "correctly" would be myTerminal = "xterm" and then later in your binding: spawn myTerminal
2010-08-18 18:29:03	geheimdienst	and in the main config, terminal = myTerminal
2010-08-18 18:29:13	allbery_b	yes
2010-08-18 18:29:24	geheimdienst	i.e. make a top-level variable and reference it from everywhere you need it

2010-10-16 10:00:44	quesada1	anyone experiencing that in FF, moving the mouse cursor to the right side makes it teleport to the top-left corner?
2010-10-16 10:01:01	quesada1	also on FF popup menus (say addons, prefs)
2010-10-16 10:01:22	quesada1	This also happens in intelliJ IDEA
2010-10-16 10:01:42	quesada1	any known workaround? it's very distracting

2010-10-16 21:11:24	dschoepe	uhsf: binding a key to `mapM_ toggleBorder . W.allWindows =<< gets windowset' should work, but I think there's function for that in some contrib module
2010-10-16 21:13:18	MrElendig	uhsf: you can toggle the noBorders modifier instead. Imo cleaner to do it that way
2010-10-16 21:16:42	uhsf	how to toggle noBorders if i don't use multitoggle?
2010-10-16 21:19:34	MrElendig	use mutlitoggle :)
2010-10-16 21:22:14	dschoepe	or try my suggestion, although I'm not certain that it will work

2010-10-16 21:24:31	MrElendig	therp: how about having both?
2010-10-16 21:24:33	therp	all configuration styles I came up with are just too ugly, and I feel like ripping out the default h,j,k,l navigation
2010-10-16 21:24:53	dschoepe	therp: Well, since the key bindings are now customizable, people who liked the old method better can still switch back
2010-10-16 21:24:57	therp	and instead plunging into substring search when hitting any characters including h,j,k,l

2010-10-16 21:28:17	therp	the problem is the abstraction done in gs_navigation is just useless
2010-10-16 21:28:28	therp	the only thing you can customize is the navigation offset, but nothing else
2010-10-16 21:28:34	therp	you can't remap escape/return for instance
2010-10-16 21:29:11	therp	so I'd have to turn this into a proper abstraction.. and also I'd have to support that keymap change on the fly as I assume people using h,j,k,l would like to have substring search, probably only when hitting something like / before
2010-10-16 21:32:15	dschoepe	I guess creating a monad for specifying grid select actions that also allows some mutable state would be the most flexible way to handle this, but also somewhat more effort
2010-10-16 21:33:26	dschoepe	Or maybe you could use X.U.ExtensibleState for storing whether e.g. a substring search was started

2010-10-16 21:36:50	therp	hmm maybe I will turn keymap into M.Map (KeyMask,KeySym) (TwoDState -> TwoDState)
2010-10-16 21:37:22	therp	this way the keymap can transform a lot more.. possibly dangerous, but.. more useful than just this offset

2010-10-17 11:03:00	bla	I've just discovered full-screen mode which seems to work with gnome fine (mod+anything shortcuts are not catched by my main xmonad) so I guess I'll be able to use it somehow. Still trying to get xinerama to work fine.
2010-10-17 11:03:23	bla	GetMeAWrapCombo, freenx also allows you to have 'suspended' X sessions to which you can later log in.
2010-10-17 11:06:23	therp	check out x2go maybe
2010-10-17 11:07:58	therp	there is also a new kid on the block.. from some guy that was frusted by neatx

2010-10-17 13:11:56	bla	Altough I was thinking about implementing this functionality in a generic CLI screen.
2010-10-17 13:12:00	bla	Fun. ;-)
2010-10-17 13:14:09	therp	X should move along much faster in my opinion..
2010-10-17 13:14:30	therp	the protocol itself. compression support, video codec support, etc. etc.
2010-10-17 13:18:53	bla	Xorg changed a lot since xfree86, but yes, it still could earn a lot by changing protocol.

2010-10-17 13:20:07	therp	all nx products are mess
2010-10-17 13:20:32	bla	It's very randomly done. And it can't work with challenge-response authentication
2010-10-17 13:20:45	bla	But the idea is very good.
2010-10-17 13:21:19	therp	yes, that's the first thing that comes to my mind that's totally odd. I do not want to have an account open on my box with a public key that has publicly known private key
2010-10-17 13:22:21	bla	Yes it's weird. I don't know why it can't just log into a user who owns sessions.
2010-10-17 13:22:37	therp	second thing, the code base is rotten. they are using what? a fork of the monolithic X server? when was that, 2006?
2010-10-17 13:22:51	therp	bla: true
2010-10-17 13:24:01	bla	So I guess this libraries from !machine which are used for compression/caching also are quite rotten.

2010-10-18 01:33:21	allbery_b	hm. did you import XMonad.Layout.Reflect?
2010-10-18 01:33:33	sietse	yes
2010-10-18 01:33:59	enthropy	what you can try is   {-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-} at the top of your config
2010-10-18 01:34:20	enthropy	it doesn't know to default to        LayoutModifier AddRoster Window
2010-10-18 01:34:41	sietse	does that have any sideeffects?
2010-10-18 01:34:43	enthropy	which certainly has that instance
2010-10-18 01:35:49	sietse	adding that declaration results in another error

2010-10-18 01:39:52	sietse	when adding the delaration I removed a trailing $
2010-10-18 01:40:10	sietse	so adding the LANGUAGE declaration solved my problem
2010-10-18 01:40:54	sietse	does that declaration has any effect which might introduce some problems?
2010-10-18 01:44:54	enthropy	sietse: the reason for the MonomorphismRestriction is to prevent mysterious performance issues when you leave off a type signature for functions written some way. You don't do any serious calculations in your config anyhow
2010-10-18 01:45:47	sietse	so adding all signatures could prevent adding the restriction?

2010-10-18 02:07:25	allbery_b	yes
2010-10-18 02:08:12	allbery_b	it also avoids weird errors popping up at the wrong place because the compiler onloy realized something was wrong when it used the incorrect type it inferred somewhere else
2010-10-18 02:11:26	allbery_b	(although I usually avoid them with xmonad because the layout types in particular really aren't intended for human consumption :)
2010-10-18 02:12:01	sietse	ok, cheers
2010-10-18 02:12:06	enthropy	and often you can't write them anyways
2010-10-18 02:12:17	enthropy	since contrib tends not to export the types
2010-10-18 02:12:54	sietse	I will try to define them once I've got my config somewhat fixed
2010-10-18 02:13:17	sietse	I prefer those instead of the hacky mono morphism declaration
2010-10-18 02:13:43	sietse	But for now I can at least continue to experiment
2010-10-18 02:13:45	allbery_b	there's an easier way to avoid that.  stick an "x" before the "=" and a "$ x" at the end of the definition
2010-10-18 02:14:13	enthropy	if anything, the monomorphism restriction is the hack (to make performance more predictable)
2010-10-18 02:14:26	allbery_b	hm, on second thought that won't ork unless you move the Tall at the end out to the call site. nemmind
2010-10-18 02:14:38	allbery_b	yeh
2010-10-18 02:15:04	sietse	ok
2010-10-18 02:15:17	sietse	thanks for the elaboration guys!
2010-10-18 02:15:54	sietse	My haskell knowledge is quite dusty (a few years ago at some functional programming course)
2010-10-18 02:16:46	sietse	next item: fix dzen2 with xft fonts ;)
2010-10-18 02:16:56	allbery_b	very short version:  numeric literals have a very polymorphic type.  The MMR and defaulting exist to keep that from spreading everywhere and causing extra indirections every time anything breathes in the vicinity of a number :)
2010-10-18 02:18:19	enthropy	allbery_b: what's a reliable way to know when a window is new / has been killed in xmonad?
2010-10-18 02:19:33	allbery_b	I don't really know, aside from hooking the eventhook and looking for substructure events

2010-10-18 02:21:05	enthropy	allbery_b: that corresponds to MapNotifyEvent?
2010-10-18 02:21:19	enthropy	and DestroyWindowEvent I think
2010-10-18 02:22:08	enthropy	logging the eventhook suggests those

2010-10-18 07:05:41	dmwit	<- totally ignorant about gnomeConfig, though
2010-10-18 07:10:01	deebo	i just copied the default config from the wiki and swapped "defaultConfig" with "gnomeConfig"

2010-10-18 08:05:45	dmwit	hpaste.org
2010-10-18 08:05:59	dmwit	You're likely overriding the default incorrectly.
2010-10-18 08:06:08	dmwit	It's hard to tell exactly what you're doing wrong without the context, though.
2010-10-18 08:07:38	digitteknohippie	http://hpaste.org/40666/xmonadhs_in_progress
2010-10-18 08:08:12	digitteknohippie	i think i see it.... i need to add something to the line:     "xmonad $ defaultConfig"  right?
2010-10-18 08:08:29	dmwit	No, I don't think so.
2010-10-18 08:08:31	dmwit	Give me a second.
2010-10-18 08:09:48	dmwit	Yeah, additionalKeys uses M.union, which is left-biased.
2010-10-18 08:09:51	dmwit	This is arguably a bug.
2010-10-18 08:10:06	digitteknohippie	oh... cool.  hpaste gives me errors i dont get elsewhere.   nice.
2010-10-18 08:10:11	dmwit	As a workaround, you can use removeKeys to take the mod4Mask binding out first.
2010-10-18 08:10:29	dmwit	You can get those errors yourself, too.
2010-10-18 08:10:32	dmwit	Download and install hlint.

2010-10-18 08:11:04	dmwit	Would you like to ask on xmonad@, or do you want me to? (About whether additionalKeys' use of union is a bug or not.)
2010-10-18 08:11:32	digitteknohippie	you'd probably know better what to ask than me.
2010-10-18 08:12:07	dmwit	alright
2010-10-18 08:12:38	dmwit	Do you need help getting removeKeys working?
2010-10-18 08:13:23	digitteknohippie	i likely will...   just realised i need to sort out some packagemanagement issues from an earlier kludgery borkage first.
2010-10-18 08:15:04	digitteknohippie	ah, nah, i see it.  removeKeys looks pretty straight forward.
2010-10-18 08:15:14	dmwit	yep
2010-10-18 08:15:52	dmwit	Wait, no, I'm confused.
2010-10-18 08:15:57	digitteknohippie	so i presume shift mod p, by default brings up gmrun?
2010-10-18 08:16:00	dmwit	Hold on.
2010-10-18 08:16:18	dmwit	I read the source incorrectly.
2010-10-18 08:16:32	dmwit	If union is left-biased as the docs say it is, the things you specify in your list should override the defaultConfig.
2010-10-18 08:16:44	dmwit	Give me a second to test this, because if what you say is true, I'm very confused.
2010-10-18 08:16:47	digitteknohippie	yup... thats what i thought too
2010-10-18 08:17:58	dmwit	Okay, I can't reproduce your problem.
2010-10-18 08:18:05	dmwit	Have you definitely recompiled and restarted xmonad?

2010-10-18 08:20:26	digitteknohippie	musta had failed on mod-q.
