2011-01-14 02:04:16	Semaj	I dont blame him, but its better than the alternative
2011-01-14 02:04:22	fgleich	genfool, he's had trouble in the recent past, but it healed up, I think taking that tub out may have caused it to rupture
2011-01-14 02:04:54	fgleich	anyway, it's a pretty common operation, and quick too
2011-01-14 02:05:01	genfool	fgleich,  am sorry to hear it.

2011-01-14 02:54:04	BillWho	<genfool> back at ya guys
2011-01-14 02:54:31	genfool	whad up bill?
2011-01-14 02:56:01	genfool	BillWho,  why do I think that (hdo,msdos) is silly?
2011-01-14 02:58:10	BillWho	<genfool> yes, I checked ubuntu and it's the sama as sabayon, but mint does it - didn't notice it before
2011-01-14 02:59:23	genfool	BillWho,  I have never seen it before,   what is creating it and why?
2011-01-14 03:01:04	BillWho	I thought the poster modified grub.cfg - I had to apologize. It seems to be an update to grub probably for msdos partition numbering? I don't know!!!
2011-01-14 03:02:46	genfool	I think they got it fixed...am not sure by their post....I still think ext4 needed to be enabled

2011-01-14 03:08:00	genfool	BillWho,  for you or I, enable ext4 in the kernel is a doh moment, try to explain it to someone else and is a deer in the headlights look...just not difficult
2011-01-14 03:10:45	BillWho	<genfool>  that's why I didn't get into it - would have gone on for days. Easier thing is install latest debian or some derivative
2011-01-14 03:11:16	genfool	but any way, I think his issue started with the debian kernel, and just followed along to where it was.
2011-01-14 03:11:37	genfool	yupp I agree BillWho
2011-01-14 03:12:27	BillWho	<genfool> yes and I told him to just grub from debian because, for some reason, he wanted debian to control grub. Should have advised to leave it alone!!!
2011-01-14 03:13:43	genfool	BillWho,  if he had set up fstab in debian to work with the new os, grub2 would have worked
2011-01-14 03:15:28	genfool	his stumbling stone was ext4 fs was not recognized, that is when you jump back into the debian kernel and enable ext4
2011-01-14 03:15:40	BillWho	<genfool>  ya think? I thought everything looked OK when he posted the stuff
2011-01-14 03:16:16	genfool	BillWho,  what are you up to today?
2011-01-14 03:20:04	BillWho	<genfool> nothing much - freekin cold tonight so a couple of drinks to stay warm - it's almost 9:30PM here

2011-01-14 03:23:10	genfool	Azerthoth,  is in the 20's at night
2011-01-14 03:23:12	BillWho	Azerthot a little warmer than that, it's 10
2011-01-14 03:23:14	Azerthoth	might have something to do with the change to mesa that was made
2011-01-14 03:23:24	Azerthoth	then its warm
2011-01-14 03:23:29	Azerthoth	ish
2011-01-14 03:23:56	genfool	but then it warms to 50....then it is 20 again

2011-01-14 03:31:15	genfool	BillWho,  is always needed, if we have 80 people logged in, majority uses nvidia, then work the # some more, not many use ati... all help is welcome.
2011-01-14 03:31:23	BillWho	<genfool>  I'm guessing Kotsen is kinda new to linux or is it just sabayon?
2011-01-14 03:31:53	genfool	kotsen just switched from ubuntu
2011-01-14 03:32:46	BillWho	diving in deeper hey!
2011-01-14 03:33:04	BillWho	I hope he can boot now!
2011-01-14 03:34:22	genfool	kotsen is doing well, just the difference from debian to gentoo can be overwhelming
2011-01-14 03:34:46	Azerthoth	baffling is a good word for it
2011-01-14 03:34:56	BillWho	sabayon is a breeze compared to genoo
2011-01-14 03:35:10	Azerthoth	the transition from debian to ubuntu is bad enough
2011-01-14 03:35:20	genfool	true... like learning a new language
2011-01-14 03:35:57	Azerthoth	meh, debian makes sense to me, gentoo makes sense to me, sabayon makes sense to me
2011-01-14 03:36:03	genfool	you all know what you want to do....how do I tell the keyboard?
2011-01-14 03:36:19	BillWho	He hasn't logged back in yet - maybe X graphics freeze!
2011-01-14 03:36:24	Azerthoth	and I can get around in arch, fedora and mandriva
2011-01-14 03:37:39	Azerthoth	slack too, but slack makes no sense to me ... or rather the philosophy behind it
2011-01-14 03:37:59	genfool	BillWho,  possible, maybe he got a kernel update...he needs to choose correct kernel or video drivers  o_0
2011-01-14 03:38:30	Azerthoth	nah, he rebooted once already, all he did this time was go from vesa to fglrx
2011-01-14 03:39:02	BillWho	Yea, shouldn't need an update
2011-01-14 03:42:31	Azerthoth	wolfden: your reality is warped enough

2011-01-14 03:46:00	BillWho	<genfool> why because it broke xbmc?

2011-01-14 06:01:54	c0nv1ct	so how is everyone dealing with their change of astrological sign?
2011-01-14 06:02:26	fgleich	I just found out that it had changed
2011-01-14 06:02:44	fgleich	04/26/48,,,,,,what am I now ?

2011-01-14 06:14:17	c0nv1ct	i thought it was all bullshit before, but now that they just change it all around at will, i know for sure
2011-01-14 06:14:32	c0nv1ct	i felt the same way when catholics got rid of purgatory...
2011-01-14 06:15:40	c0nv1ct	though, oddly enough, going from aquarius to capricorn makes more sense, since aquarius was supposed to be an extrovert which i am totally not and capricorn is an introvert which i completely am

2011-01-14 06:22:39	c0nv1ct	oh, i figured they finally gave it since it is well known that the signs don't actually line up anymore
2011-01-14 06:23:58	Semaj	heh, for the symbol minded? thats bloody likely
