2010-08-22 23:39:28	SimonLarsen	Hey guys. I'm trying to get headphone jack working with my Intel HDA (snd-hda-intel) sound card. After folling around for several hours it seems like it's now ignoring any 'model=xxx' i put in /modprobe.d/. Are there any config file that cause modprobe to ignore my options?

2010-08-23 08:23:40	gorus	i think slackware 8 it was

2010-08-23 08:28:48	eclectricsheep	goddamn this is taking a while
2010-08-23 08:28:48	aaronyy	the problem is there's no dependency between arch daemons
2010-08-23 08:28:48	Splex	Evanlec: put your cursor next to the character you want to change
2010-08-23 08:28:48	Evanlec	gorus: nvm i got it
2010-08-23 08:28:48	gorus	took me about 4 hours to go back to arch :)
2010-08-23 08:28:48	aaronyy	so it's either background daemon or non background
2010-08-23 08:28:48	gorus	Evanlec look for flow text into object

2010-08-23 08:32:03	gorus	ctrl+shift+c

2010-08-23 08:33:55	gorus	what you mean ?

2010-08-23 08:34:16	gorus	do you place text around images ??

2010-08-23 08:34:25	gorus	or other boxed text ?

2010-08-23 08:35:07	Evanlec	and im putting text over it
2010-08-23 08:35:08	gorus	dont use inkscape in that case .. get some word processing or speadsheet
2010-08-23 08:35:13	Evanlec	gorus: wont work like that, its scanned in as a pdf
2010-08-23 08:35:18	aaronyy	or just use ssl repo server
2010-08-23 08:35:56	Splex	inkscape is fine for that
2010-08-23 08:36:22	Splex	just lock the background image in place
2010-08-23 08:36:28	Evanlec	Splex: yea ;)
2010-08-23 08:36:28	Splex	and overlay the text

2010-08-23 08:36:39	Splex	right-click, object properties
2010-08-23 08:36:41	Splex	check the lock box
2010-08-23 08:36:52	gorus	i think its easier to put your image on the bottom layer
2010-08-23 08:36:58	gorus	and lock that layer alltogether
2010-08-23 08:37:03	Splex	that would work too
2010-08-23 08:37:12	gorus	thats how i do it most of the time
