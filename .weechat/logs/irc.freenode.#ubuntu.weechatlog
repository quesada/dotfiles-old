However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)

However, your original question mentioned swap. The swap isn't generally used for caching because it's slow, and caching data from the hard disk on the hard disk is rather pointless.

I've removed the ppa, but the ricotz packages are still installed. can I savely remove them? and then reinstall? (libgtk) being the main one, without risk of damaging my system?

2010-08-15 16:00:58	ubottu	baba: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)

2010-08-15 17:18:01	headkase314	Magkakos, if you are not using your Ubuntu system for 3d games and nouveau does compiz effects for you just fine then nouveau is better.  If you want full 3d functionality then the proprietary nv is better.  Also, you should install the proprietary nv from System > Administration > Hardware Drivers as installing the .run file from nvidia.com can cause issues later when a kernel update comes along.

2010-09-09 02:34:07	dominicdinada	Question I am always getting dbus error messages because when shutting down or what not the session file is not being flushed. How do i add an cron or upstart job to kill the dbus session so i dont get the errors
2010-09-09 02:34:17	jrib	dominicdinada: I read that already
2010-09-09 02:34:19	dominicdinada	1. click to connect. 2. connection fails. 3. exit out of failed connection window. 4. open up home folder. 5. ctrl+h 6. browse to .dbus. 7. goto session 8. delete session 9. attempt to connect. 10 fails at least 3 times till system realizes the session is flushed
